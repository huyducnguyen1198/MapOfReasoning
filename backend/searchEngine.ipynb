Since the will is\\nactive all the time, it must decide between its three acts of volition\\n(velle volitionem), nolition (velle nolitionem), or\\nnot-willing (non-velle). With regard to its own internal\\nacts, the will is absolutely free. With regard to its external acts,\\nhowever, it chooses between wanting something (velle aliquid)\\nand not wanting something (nolle aliquid). In these cases,\\nthe will is also absolutely free to make such a choice.</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nThe third Aristotelian work on which Richard Kilvington commented\\nduring his regency in the Arts Faculty was the Nicomachean\\nEthics. His commentary on the second and tenth books of the\\nEthics takes a form of ten questions, which deal only with\\nselected issues that were the subjects of Kilvington’s lectures\\nat Oxford: e.g., creating and destroying moral virtue, free acts of\\nvolition, the behavior of honest people and the delight taken in their\\nactions (or conversely, the punishment of those who act evilly), and\\nquestions concerning particular virtues such as courage, generosity,\\nmagnanimity, justice, and prudence. As Michałowska has shown,\\nKilvington uses terminist logic and mathematical physics to solve\\nethical problems (see Michałowska 2011a, 2016).\\nMichałowska also shows that, just as he did in his questions on\\nthe Physics, Kilvington follows Ockham’s minimalist\\nontology by treating ethical qualities—i.e., vices and virtues,\\ncognition and wisdom, good and evil—as volition-like objects,\\ncalling them res. Being real things and not merely mental\\nconcepts, they can be measured by addition, subtraction, and division\\ninto parts, for they undergo change via increase or decrease and so\\nhave varying degrees of intensity. Such changes—e.g., undergoing\\npunishment for an evil act—cannot be instantaneous and must\\nhappen in time. Each change is the result of an acting power\\novercoming resistance. In the case of moral acts, the changes do not\\nproduce any external effects but internal modifications in terms of\\nthe intensity of virtues and vices. When a vice acts upon a virtue, it\\ncauses its continuous change, and so someone’s courage can vary\\nin intensity. Virtues and vices are opposed in Kilvington’s\\nphysical theory, so it is impossible for someone to be vicious and\\nvirtuous at the same time, although it is possible for them to be\\ngenerous at one time, miserly at another.</td>\n",

Many rulers and government ministers in\\nConfucius’s era advocated the use of military power to address\\nexternal threats and strict punishments to deal with internal\\ndisorder. Confucius did not completely dismiss the use of force, but\\nhe regarded it as a last resort, and as ultimately ineffective when\\nused as the primary method of governing. “If you try to guide\\nthe common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with\\npunishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no\\nsense of shame” (Analects 2.3; Slingerland 2003, 8).\\n(We see a similar denigration of the use of brute force in Mencius. In\\na memorable turn of phrase, Mencius warned one ruler that to attempt\\nto conquer the world through warfare is as hopeless as “climbing\\na tree in search of a fish” [1A7].) In place of penal sanctions,\\nConfucius advocated leading the people by moral inspiration and by the\\nsubtle but ubiquitous effect of social mores: “If, however, you\\nguide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the\\npeople will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves”\\n(ibid.). Confucius’s reference to Virtue here reflects the\\nconcept’s political origins. The word we render\\n“Virtue” is “de.” It originally\\nreferred to a sort of political charisma a king accumulated through\\nhis good character and acts of kindness and generosity. Subjects would\\nwillingly follow a ruler with Virtue, without the need for coercion.\\nAlthough Virtue was originally something only a true king could\\npossess, it came to be thought of as an attribute of any person with\\ngood character (i.e., a “virtuous” person), regardless of\\nsocial\\n status.[3]\\n By the end of the Zhou dynasty, it had come to be used as a countable\\nnoun referring to specific virtues, such as benevolence, courage, and\\n wisdom.[4]\\n Although de is thus very close to our concept of virtue, its\\nassociations with royal charisma are distinctive. Consequently, it has\\nbecome conventional to use “Virtue” (with a capital\\n“V”) when translating the specific term\\n“de,” and to use “virtue” (with a\\nlower case “v”) when one needs a generic term for\\nreferring to traits of good character, such as righteousness and\\nloyalty.</td>\n",

Employing an\\nagricultural metaphor, he refers to these tendencies as\\n“sprouts” (2A6). The sprouts are manifested in cognitive\\nand emotional reactions characteristic of the virtues. For example,\\nall humans feel compassion for the suffering of other humans and\\nanimals, at least on some occasions, and this is a manifestation of\\nbenevolence. Similarly, every person has some things that he or she\\nwould be ashamed to do, or some forms of treatment he or she would\\ndisdain to accept, and these are expressions of righteousness.\\nHowever, as Mencius’s carefully chosen sprout metaphor suggests,\\nhumans are not born with fully formed virtuous dispositions. Our\\nnascent virtues are sporadic and inconsistent in their manifestations.\\nConsequently, a ruler who manifests genuine benevolence when he spares\\nan ox being led to slaughter may nonetheless ignore the suffering of\\nhis own subjects. Likewise, someone who would disdain to be addressed\\ndisrespectfully may feel no compunction in acting against his\\nconvictions in the face of a large bribe. In order to become genuinely\\nvirtuous, a person must “extend” or “fill out”\\nhis or her nascent virtuous inclinations. As Mencius puts it:\\n“People all have things that they will not bear. To extend this\\nreaction to that which they will bear is benevolence. People all have\\nthings that they will not do. To extend this reaction to that which\\nthey will do is righteousness. If people can fill out the heart that\\ndoes not desire to harm others, their benevolence will be\\ninexhaustible. If people can fill out the heart that will not\\ntrespass, their righteousness will be inexhaustible”\\n(Mengzi 7B31; Van Norden 2008, 192). One of the most\\nintriguing issues in Mencius’s philosophy is the proper way to\\nunderstand his claim that we must “extend” (tui, ji,\\nda) or “fill out” (kuo, chong) our innate\\nbut incipient virtuous reactions (1A7, 2A6, 7A15, 7B31).</td>\n",

Clearly, God cannot\\nchoose to do evil. But to choose contrary to what is judged to be best\\nis evil or morally wrong only if choosing to do what is judged to be\\nbest is morally obligatory. To claim that it is morally obligatory\\nignores the real possibility that choosing what is best is\\nsupererogatory, beyond the call of duty. There are choices which are\\ngood to make but not required as our duty. It would be a mistake,\\ntherefore, to infer God's inability to choose to act contrary to what\\nhe judges to be best from his inability to choose to do evil.\\nNevertheless, it does seem to be logically impossible for perfect\\ngoodness to choose to act contrary to what is best. And this seems to\\nbe Clarke's own view of the matter. Thus he declares “that\\nthough God is a most perfectly free agent, yet he cannot but do always\\nwhat is best and wisest in the whole” (1738, 120-121). To choose\\notherwise, he thinks, is to act contrary to perfect wisdom and\\ngoodness.</td>\n",

In the second\\ncase, the contradiction is in the idea of a perfectly good being\\nchoosing to do evil.

For we believe they were free to reject the\\ncounsel of reason and act otherwise. But what if God cannot reject the\\ncounsel of his reason as to what action to perform? A human agent who\\nis morally good and rational may yet have — or previously had\\n— the power to refrain from acting as his goodness and reason\\ndirect. But can this be true of God?

It is to render the agent's act necessary and to deny\\nthe agent's freedom of will. Thus, for Clarke, a reason or motive may\\nbe the sufficient reason for the agent's action.

In its\\nnascency, reason is a power that defines itself against an other, an\\nother whose truth and identity is also assigned by reason, thus\\ngiving reason the sense of originating from itself. For Foucault, the\\nissue is that madness is not allowed to speak for itself and is at\\nthe disposal of a power that dictates the terms of their\\nrelationship. As he remarks: “What is originative is the\\ncaesura that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason;\\nreason's subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as\\nmadness, crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this\\npoint” (Foucault 1965, x). The truth of reason is found\\nwhen madness comes to stand in the place of non-reason, when the\\ndifference between them is inscribed in their opposition, but is not\\nidentical to its dominant side. In other words, the reason that\\nstands in opposition to madness is not identical to the reason that\\ninscribes their difference. The latter would be reason without an\\nopposite, a free-floating power without definite shape. As Foucault\\nsuggests, this free-floating mystery might be represented in the ship\\nof fools motif, which, in medieval times, represented madness.

Boethius\\n(c. 480–524) gave us the definition of the concept of\\n‘person’ that has been fundamental to ethical theory. To\\nunderstand this, we need to go back into the history of the\\ndevelopment of the doctrine of the Trinity. The church had to explain\\nhow the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit could be distinct and yet\\nnot three different gods. They used, in Latin, the\\nterm persona, which means ‘role’ but which was\\nalso used by the grammarians to distinguish what we call ‘first\\nperson, second person and third person’ pronouns and\\nverb-forms. The same human being can be first person ‘I’,\\nsecond person ‘you’, and third person ‘he’ or\\n‘she’, depending on the relations in which he or she\\nstands. The doctrine of the Trinity comes to be understood in terms of\\nthree persons, one God, with the persons standing in different\\nrelations to each other. But then this term ‘person’ is\\nalso used to understand the relation of the second person's divinity\\nto his humanity. The church came to talk about one person with two\\nnatures, the person standing under the natures. This had the merit of\\nnot making either the humanity or the divinity less essential to who\\nJesus was. Plato and Aristotle did not have any term that we can\\ntranslate ‘person’ in the modern sense, as\\nsomeone (as opposed to something) that stands under\\nall his or her attributes. Boethius, however, defines\\n‘person’ as ‘individual substance of rational\\nnature,’ a key step in the introduction of our present\\nconcept.</td>\n",

There he identifies the operation of a creature with\\nits end. “This operation,” he tells us, “is the end\\nof the thing, for the sake of which the thing exists.” Then he\\ngoes on to reveal how he conceives this operation to link one being\\nwith another: “By means of this operation a thing tends beyond\\nitself. It is due to this operation that there is found in each thing\\nnot only being and truth, but also goodness. Thus each thing is\\ninterchangeably being, true, and good.  Consequently, it is a being\\nwith respect to itself, true as ordered to the intellect, and good\\ninsofar as it actively overflows into something beyond itself.”\\nThis is a remarkable view of operation and end.

William of Ockham, for\\nexample, despaired of explaining how God could come to know the future\\nfree decisions of the creatures (Shields 1993, 298). Luis de Molina\\ndeveloped the chief rival in classical theism to Aquinas’s\\naccount of the mechanics of omniscience. Molinism has been much\\ndiscussed in recent literature and vigorously defended (Shields &amp;\\nViney 2004, 241, n. 15). Molina claims that there are true statements\\nabout what any possible creature would freely do in any\\nsituation in which that creature existed. The truth of these\\nstatements, called “middle knowledge conditionals,” is\\ndecided by neither God nor the creatures; they are simply eternally\\ntrue, a kind of innate divine knowledge. Molina agrees with Aquinas\\nthat the deity knows the product of its own creative\\nactivity—called “free knowledge” (Kenny 1979, 62).\\nUsing free knowledge, in conjunction with middle knowledge\\nconditionals, God can deduce what any actual creature will freely\\ndo. The deduction has the form: “If individual X\\nwere in situation S, then X would freely decide\\nA” (middle knowledge conditional); and\\n“X is in S” (God’s free\\nknowledge); therefore, “X will freely decide\\nA.” Molina’s theory is designed to save both the\\nfreedom of the creatures and the divine immutability and\\nimpassibility. Thus, it poses as much of a challenge to process theism\\nas does Thomism which claims for itself the same advantages.</td>\n",

Of course,\\nthe one with experience may be more effective than the inexperienced\\nperson who has only the rational account. Still, we think the\\ncraftsman wiser than the empiric because of his knowledge of the\\naccount (Metaphysics 981a 5–30). The suppressed\\nconclusion is that wisdom is characterized by knowledge of causes\\nquite apart from the utility of knowing the causes. Another argument\\nshows that wisdom is not productive knowledge. Since wonder is the\\nbeginning of philosophy, satisfying that wonder is an end in itself.\\nIn fact, this kind of pursuit arose when the requirements of necessity\\nand ease were satisfied (Metaphysics 982b 10–15).

The latter idea is a distinct development in\\nthinking about the relation between knowledge and craft.

Classic utilitarianism added up the values\\nwithin each part of the consequences to determine which total set of\\nconsequences has the most value in it. One could, instead, aggregate\\ngoods for each individual but not aggregate goods of separate\\nindividuals (Roberts 2002). Or one could give up aggregation\\naltogether and just rank total sets of consequences or total worlds\\ncreated by acts without breaking those worlds down into valuable\\nparts. One motive for this move is Moore’s principle of organic unity\\n(Moore 1903, 27–36), which claims that the value of a combination or “organic unity” of two or more things cannot be calculated simply by adding the values of the things that are combined or unified. For example, even if punishment of a criminal\\ncauses pain, a consequentialist can hold that a world with both the\\ncrime and the punishment is better than a world with the crime but not\\nthe punishment, perhaps because the former contains more\\njustice. Similarly, a world might seem better when people do not get\\npleasures that they do not deserve. Cases like these lead some\\nconsequentialists to deny that moral rightness is any function of the\\nvalues of particular effects of acts. Instead, they compare the whole\\nworld (or total set of consequences) that results from an action with\\nthe whole world that results from not doing that action. If the former\\nis better, then the action is morally right (J.J.C. Smart 1973, 32;\\nFeldman 1997, 17–35). This approach can be called holistic\\nconsequentialism or world utilitarianism.</td>\n",

Strength of will is probably a formal\\nrelation one has to oneself. Very roughly, we might say that a display\\nof strength of will is a particular relation between a person’s\\nintention and corresponding action: it is a matter of acting on an\\nintention given serious obstacles to the action. This is a formal\\nrelation to the self in the sense we are after because we don’t\\nneed to evaluate the appropriateness, value, justice, practical\\nwisdom, and so on, either of the intention or corresponding action in\\norder to identify the whole thing as a case of strength of will. We\\nmight think that all displays of strength of will are valuable, so we\\nmight have certain pro-attitudes to an action simply because it is an\\nattempt to fulfill an intention in the face of serious obstacles. Yet\\nwe don’t need to make this evaluation in order to attribute a\\ndisplay of strength of will to someone. All we need to do is inspect\\nthe correspondence of intention and action given the difficulty of\\nacting on the intention. We don’t need to evaluate whether the\\nintention is directed at anything worthwhile, for example. John\\nBigelow and Robert Pargetter (2007) argue that strength of will is the\\ncore of integrity (and that alternative conceptions of integrity tend\\nto confuse integrity with authenticity). The self-integration account\\nof integrity takes this formal characterization of integrity a step\\nfurther. Self-integration is an achievement rather than a quality or\\ndisposition such as strength of will — though strength of will\\nis likely to be an important quality in those who achieve\\nself-integration. Self-integration still represents a formal account\\nof integrity. In attributing self-integration to a person we are\\nmaking no evaluative judgement of the states that are integrated\\nwithin the person.</td>\n",

The power to suspend is the power\\nto keep one’s will from being determined, that is, the power to\\nforbear willing to do A if one wills to forbear willing to\\ndo A. This is just one part of the freedom to will to\\ndo A, according to Locke’s definition of freedom of\\naction applied to the action of willing to do A. (The other\\npart is the power to will to do A if one wills to will to\\ndo A.) Thus if, as Locke seems to argue in II.xxi.23–24,\\nwe are (except under very unusual circumstances) free with respect to\\nthe act of willing with respect to a future course of action, then it\\nfollows immediately that we have the power to suspend. Locke’s\\nclaims about the power to suspend being the source of all liberty and\\nthe hinge on which liberty turns can be understood as claims that the\\npower to suspend is a particularly important aspect of freedom of\\naction as applied to the action of willing. What makes it important is\\nthe fact that it is the misuse of this freedom that accounts for our\\nresponsibility for actions that conduce to our own unhappiness or\\nmisery.</td>\n",

Yet one virtue in particular reigns supreme and\\ncontains all the others, and that virtue is justice, which Leibniz\\ndefines as the “charity of the wise man” (PW, “Codex\\nIuris Gentium,” p. 171; cf.

Consider how\\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making — created\\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\\ninternal to “the will of the people.” It is because the\\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\\nKant’s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\\nsuch a principle. Hence, the “moral legitimacy” of the CI\\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person’s own\\nrational will. It is because each person’s own reason is the\\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).</td>\n",

Rather, God freely subordinated his own actions to the\\nobtainment of certain specific conditions, namely, certain states of\\nnatural beings or of human minds. Sturm does not extensively use the\\nMalebranchian terminology of occasional causes, but he does explicitly\\nequate occasional causes with sine quibus non causes (PE I:\\n117). A sine qua non cause is a (counterfactually) necessary\\ncondition for the production of a certain effect, although the\\nsine qua non cause does not truly contribute to its\\nproduction in virtue of any active power it possesses (see Sangiacomo\\n2019). Sturm’s account of God’s hypothetical power entails\\nthat all natural forms are sine quibus non conditions for the\\nproduction of natural effects, in the sense that they do not\\ncontribute in virtue of any active power they might have (since they\\nhave none), but rather because God (freely) established to bring about\\ncertain effects as consequences of certain modifications (i.e., forms)\\nof matter. Since (what Malebranche calls) ‘occasional\\ncauses’ can be understood in terms of sine qua non\\ncausation, and since Sturm maintains that all natural forms work as\\nsine quibus non causes of natural effects, it seems safe to\\nconclude that Sturm supports a version of occasionalism.</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nThe philosophical analysis of emotions was introduced by Plato and\\ndeveloped further by Aristotle. In the fourth Book of his\\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\\n(epithumêtikon). This terminology was also used by\\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\\nand concupiscibilis. Plato’s view of emotions was\\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\\naction-initiating impulses. Plato’s main reason for this\\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression.</td>\n",

Inner senses are\\nnon-perceptual apprehensive powers of the sensory soul (De\\nanima IV.1, 1–11; IV.3, 37–40). The moving power of\\nthe sensory soul is divided into a commanding power and an executive\\npower, the former of which is the center of emotions. The executive\\nmoving power operates through the nervous system and the muscles. It\\nis moved by the commanding moving power, the acts of which are\\ntriggered by an occurrent evaluation of estimative power and\\naccompanied by bodily affections as well as behavioral changes,\\nprovided that the executive moving power is also actualized. If the\\ncommanding act is strong enough, the executive power is necessarily\\nactualized in animals, but not so in humans because they can prevent\\nthe impulse of the executive moving power by their will. The will is\\nthe moving power of the immaterial intellectual soul. Together with\\npractical intellect, it should control the emotions (De anima\\nI.5, 94; IV.4, 54–56, 59).</td>\n",

For Numenius functions of this kind,\\nsuch as perception, memory, and desire, are not essential to the soul\\nand are later additions to it (fr. 43.7–9), coming into\\nexistence with its embodiment. Numenius apparently held that the human\\nsoul is an intellect that descended to human bodies through the\\nplanets (fr.  12.14–16). This is a view that also Celsus shared\\n(Origen, Against Celsus VI.21; see Frede 1994, 5211), which\\nwe can find also in Hermetic treatises (Corpus Hermeticum. I.25;\\nDodds 1960, 8). Furthermore, Origen also adopts the view that the\\nhuman soul is essentially an intellect that falls in bodies and then\\nbecomes a soul with the necessary faculties to operate within a human\\nbody, yet the soul retains the ability to ascend and become an\\nintellect again (On Principles I.4.1, I.8.1, II.6.4,\\nII.9.7). Numenius arrives at this view guided by the analogy of the\\nCave and the story of Er in Republic VII and X respectively,\\nbut also by the description of the creation of the soul in\\nthe Timaeus (41e), according to which the demiurge mounts the\\nsouls on vehicles (ochêmata). Porphyry in his\\nwork The Cave of Nymphs makes clear that he relies on\\nNumenius' exegesis of the soul's descent to bodies through the planets\\n(frs. 30–33) and speaks of the honey offered by the astrologists\\nin anticipation of the future pleasures of the souls in earth\\n(fr. 32).

Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\\nGod.

Toward the end of the book, Socrates\\nconducts a three-part contest to show the philosophical, or\\naristocratic, man is the happiest. In the second of these contests, he\\nclaims that each part of the soul has its peculiar desire and\\ncorresponding pleasure. Reason, for instance, desires to learn;\\nsatisfying that desire is a pleasure distinct from the pleasure, e.g.,\\nof eating (580d–e). One can now see that the functions of each\\nof the parts has a new, affective dimension. Then, in the last of the\\ncontests, Socrates makes an ontological distinction between true\\npleasure of the soul and less true pleasure of the body. The former is\\nthe pleasure of knowing being, i.e., the forms, and the latter is the\\npleasure of filling bodily appetite. The less true pleasures also give\\nrise to illusions and phantoms of pleasure; these illusions and\\nphantoms recall the images and shadows in the allegory of the cave\\n(583b–586c). Clearly, then, distinctions from the metaphysics\\nand epistemology of the central books are being made relevant to the\\ndivisions within the soul. Pleasures of reason are on a higher\\nontological level than those of the bodily appetites; this difference\\ncalls for a modification of the definitions of the virtues from Book\\nIV. For instance, in Book IV, justice is each part fulfilling its own\\nfunction; in Book IX, that function is specified in terms of the kinds\\nof pleasure each part pursues. Reason pursues the true pleasure of\\nknowing and the appetites the less true pleasure of the body. Appetite\\ncommits injustice if it pursues pleasure not proper to it, i.e., if it\\npursues bodily pleasures as though they were true pleasures\\n(586d–587a). The result is an account of virtue which\\ndiscriminates among pleasures, as any virtue ethics should; but the\\ncriterion of discrimination reflects the distinction between being and\\nbecoming. Rational pleasures are more real than bodily pleasures,\\nalthough bodily pleasures are not negligible. Happiness, in turn,\\nintegrates the virtue of managing bodily appetites and pleasures with\\nthe pleasures of learning, but definitely gives greater weight to the\\nlatter.</td>\n",

At this point, we should note the difficulty of\\ntalking about parts of the soul. In making his argument about conflict\\nin the soul, Socrates does not usually use a word that easily\\ncorresponds to the English ‘part.’ Sometimes he uses\\n‘form’ (eidos) and ‘kind’\\n(genos) (435b–c), other times a periphrasis such as\\n‘that in the soul that calculates’ (439d–e),\\nalthough in the subsequent account of virtue, we do find\\nmeros, which means part (442b–d). So, insofar as\\nvocabulary is concerned, one should be cautious about taking the\\nsubdivisions of the soul to be independent agents. Perhaps the least\\nmisleading way of thinking about the parts is as distinct functions.\\nReason is the function of calculating, especially about what is good\\nfor the soul. The appetites for food, drink, and sex are like the\\nproducing class – they are necessary for bodily existence\\n(439c–e). These two parts are familiar to the modern reader, who\\nwill recognize the psychological capacity for reasoning and\\ncalculating, on the one hand, and the bodily desires, on the other.\\nLess familiar is the part of the soul that corresponds to the\\nauxiliaries, the military class. This is the spirited part\\n(thymos or thymoeides). Associated with the heart,\\nit is an aggressive drive concerned with honor. Thumos is\\nmanifested as anger with those who attack one’s honor. Perhaps\\nmore importantly, it is manifested as anger with oneself when failing\\nto do what one knows he should do (439e–440d).</td>\n",

In the case of those who choose in God’s favor, at\\nleast, moral evil is defeated in that it is bound up in a\\ntotal state of affairs that counts as a far greater good, in which the\\nevil is addressed and overcome. The very autonomy that the sinner once\\ninsisted upon is surrendered to God, thus becoming the foundation for\\na new understanding and a richer relationship, in which one is able to\\nact as an informed and wholehearted participant in the divine\\nenterprise of working good. Sin does not function as a causal means in\\nthis process, nor is it simply overbalanced by some other good with\\nwhich it coexists. It encountered and overcome, through the\\nprovidential operation of God, as manifested in creaturely\\nfreedom.</td>\n",

Instead, the movement to new determinations is driven by\\nthe nature of the earlier determinations and so “comes about on\\nits own accord” (PhG-P §79). Indeed, for Hegel, the\\nmovement is driven by necessity (see, e.g., EL Remarks to\\n§§12, 42, 81, 87, 88; PhG §79). The natures of the\\ndeterminations themselves drive or force them to pass into\\ntheir opposites. This sense of necessity—the idea that\\nthe method involves being forced from earlier moments to later\\nones—leads Hegel to regard his dialectics as a kind of\\nlogic. As he says in the Phenomenology, the\\nmethod’s “proper exposition belongs to logic” (PhG-M\\n§48). Necessity—the sense of being driven or forced to\\nconclusions—is the hallmark of “logic” in Western\\nphilosophy.</td>\n",

The concept\\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.</td>\n",

For example, in some places Descartes identifies things as\\nhaving possible existence to highlight that they are dependent\\ncreatures, and creatures whose existence cannot be read straight from\\ntheir concept. To describe the kind of existence had by finite\\ncreatures generally, he uses ‘possible existence’ and\\n‘contingent existence’ interchangeably: he sometimes\\nspeaks of the beings that depend on God for their existence as having\\n“possible or contingent existence” (Second\\nReplies, AT 7:166, CSM 2:117; Notae, AT 8B:361, CSM\\n1:306), and sometimes he speaks of them as having just\\n“contingent existence” (Principles I.15, AT\\n8A:10, CSM 1:198). When he says that creatures have possible\\nor contingent existence, he identifies the two kinds of\\nexistence: “possible or [vel] contingent\\nexistence.” If contingent existence is just the kind of\\nexistence had by beings that depend for their existence on God’s\\nwill and whose existence cannot be established by an analysis of their\\nconcept alone (Fifth Meditation, AT 7:63–66, CSM 2:44–46;\\nRules for the Direction of the Mind, AT 10:421–22, CSM\\n1:45–46), then the fact that a thing has possible existence in\\nDescartes’ ontology does not suggest that the thing does not\\nactually exist. Such a thing exists, but in a way that has it wholly\\ndependent on God. Descartes also suggests this definition of\\n“possible existence” when he contrasts necessary existence\\nwith the kind of existence had by creatures in First Replies:\\nunlike necessary existence, the existence had by a creature is marked\\nby the fact that it “has no power to create itself or maintain\\nitself in existence” (AT 7:118, CSM 2:84).

But there is an even weaker condition\\nthan having a lower bound that can satisfy\\n (MF),\\n namely, Rabin &amp; Rabern’s (2016: 363) “having a\\nfoundation” or Dixon’s (2016: 446) equivalent “full\\nfoundations”. Both of these are based on the idea of having an\\ninfinitely large foundation. An example of this type of foundation can\\nbe constructed with the help of infinitary disjunctions, as both Rabin\\n&amp; Rabern and Dixon demonstrate (Litland 2016b discusses the\\nproblems associated with this and constructs further examples). In\\nsuch a case, (MF) is satisfied because every element depends on some\\nindependent element, despite there being no lower bound. There is no\\nlower bound because the chain does not terminate if the foundation is\\ninfinitely large. In contrast, if the foundation is finite, then the\\nthere is a lower bound and hence the weaker requirement of (MF) is\\nalso entailed. In decreasing order of strength, we have the\\nrequirement of set-theoretical well-foundedness, having a lower bound,\\nand having a foundation or full foundations. We defined (MF) in terms\\nof the weakest of these three requirements in\\n section 2,\\n but a proponent of metaphysical foundationalism may of course make a\\nstronger requirement as well, such as having a lower bound.</td>\n",

We can say that an order &lt; on a domain is\\nbounded from below if any subset of that domain has a lower bound.\\nMore precisely, a lower bound of a given set is any element that is\\nmore minimal or equal to all of the elements of the set. For example,\\n1, 2, and 3 are all lower bounds of the interval [3, 4, 5]. A lower\\nbound of a set does not need to be an element of the set itself.\\nConsequently, the chain \\(f &lt; \\ldots d_{3} &lt; d_{2} &lt; d_{1}\\),\\nis bounded from below. More generally, any finite chain is\\nset-theoretically well-founded and bounded from below. We’ve\\njust seen that some infinitely descending chains of dependence may be\\nbounded from below yet fail to be set-theoretically well-founded. As\\nRabin &amp; Rabern (2016: 360) put it, an infinitely descending chain\\nmay or may not have a “limit”, where limit is the greatest\\nlower bound of a set. In the previous example, 3 is the greatest lower\\nbound of the interval [3, 4, 5]. So, one might suggest that the\\nrelevant sense of metaphysical well-foundedness is captured either by\\nthis idea of being bounded from below or by having a limit, a greatest\\nlower bound. But it turns out that even these may be too strong. This\\nis the key insight in the recent work of Dixon and Rabin &amp; Rabern.\\nIf this is right, then we need to have a sense of a metaphysical\\nfoundation that is not only compatible with infinite chains of\\ndependence, but also with infinite chains that do not have a lower\\nbound (i.e., “unbounded”\\n chains).[22]</td>\n",

There were two disputants, Opponens and\\nRespondens. At the beginning of a session, the disputants would agree\\non a ‘positum’, typically a false statement. The job of\\nRespondens was to give rational answers to questions from Opponens,\\nassuming the truth of the positum; above all he had to avoid\\ncontradicting himself unnecessarily. The job of Opponens was to try to\\nforce Respondens into contradictions. So we broadly know the answer to\\nthe Dawkins question, but we don’t know the game rules! The\\nmedieval textbooks do describe several rules that the disputants\\nshould follow. But these rules are not stipulated rules of the game;\\nthey are guidelines which the textbooks derive from principles of\\nsound reasoning with the aid of examples. (Paul of Venice justifies\\none rule by the practice of ‘great logicians, philosophers,\\ngeometers and theologians’.) In particular it was open to a\\nteacher of obligationes to discover new rules. This open-endedness\\nimplies that obligationes are not logical games in our sense.   \n",

Kilvington distinguishes three types of human\\nvolitional acts: willing, nilling, and not-willing. Willing always\\nwills, and can never be passive or in potency. Even when the will\\nwants nothing (velle nihil), it is willing, and so it cannot\\nrest and is always determined to an act of willing. Here Kilvington\\nseems to be directly influenced by Scotus, who claims that the will\\ncannot be suspended (Ord. I d.1). The will is absolutely free\\nin its acts of willing, and the free will of volition is the primary\\nprinciple in the genus of contingent propositions. Since the will is\\nactive all the time, it must decide between its three acts of volition\\n(velle volitionem), nolition (velle nolitionem), or\\nnot-willing (non-velle). With regard to its own internal\\nacts, the will is absolutely free. With regard to its external acts,\\nhowever, it chooses between wanting something (velle aliquid)\\nand not wanting something (nolle aliquid). In these cases,\\nthe will is also absolutely free to make such a choice.   \n",

His commentary on the second and tenth books of the\\nEthics takes a form of ten questions, which deal only with\\nselected issues that were the subjects of Kilvington’s lectures\\nat Oxford: e.g., creating and destroying moral virtue, free acts of\\nvolition, the behavior of honest people and the delight taken in their\\nactions (or conversely, the punishment of those who act evilly), and\\nquestions concerning particular virtues such as courage, generosity,\\nmagnanimity, justice, and prudence. As Michałowska has shown,\\nKilvington uses terminist logic and mathematical physics to solve\\nethical problems (see Michałowska 2011a, 2016).\\nMichałowska also shows that, just as he did in his questions on\\nthe Physics, Kilvington follows Ockham’s minimalist\\nontology by treating ethical qualities—i.e., vices and virtues,\\ncognition and wisdom, good and evil—as volition-like objects,\\ncalling them res. Being real things and not merely mental\\nconcepts, they can be measured by addition, subtraction, and division\\ninto parts, for they undergo change via increase or decrease and so\\nhave varying degrees of intensity. Such changes—e.g., undergoing\\npunishment for an evil act—cannot be instantaneous and must\\nhappen in time. Each change is the result of an acting power\\novercoming resistance. In the case of moral acts, the changes do not\\nproduce any external effects but internal modifications in terms of\\nthe intensity of virtues and vices. When a vice acts upon a virtue, it\\ncauses its continuous change, and so someone’s courage can vary\\nin intensity. Virtues and vices are opposed in Kilvington’s\\nphysical theory, so it is impossible for someone to be vicious and\\nvirtuous at the same time, although it is possible for them to be\\ngenerous at one time, miserly at another.   \n",

Kilvington argues that\\nGod produces the substance of people’s volitional act, that is,\\ntheir ability to make choices, and interacts with human free will to\\nintensify good deeds and to produce certain degrees of these acts. He\\nargues that if free will were solely responsible for the degree of its\\nact, then someone could love God whether endowed with grace or not,\\nand someone without grace could love God above everything else, which\\nis absurd. God only contributes to the performance of good deeds, and\\nevil deeds result from the choices of human free will alone, because\\n“truly we are good because of God, and <we are> evil all\\nby ourselves.”(Jung & Michałowska 2022: 46) It is\\nobvious, however, that even if humans perform good deeds, God does not\\nhave to take them into account or reward humans for their meritorious\\nacts. People cannot be the primary cause of their reward, but they are\\nthe primary cause of their punishment because they voluntarily make\\nwrong choices and perform evil acts. The capacity to sin\\ntestifies to the freedom of people to make free choices (see\\nJung & Michałowska 2022: 51–52 )   \n",

A God who was less than maximally perfect would not\\nbe an absolute reality and an appropriate object of worship. A God who\\nwas less than ultimate and absolute would be an idol. Now an absolute\\nreality must be a se, from itself, and so not dependent on\\nanything distinct from itself either for its nature or for its\\nexistence. If God had properties in the way creatures have them,\\nhowever, he would be distinct from them and so dependent on them. This\\nis the case whether one thinks of a property of x as a\\nconstituent of x, or as an entity external to x to\\nwhich x is tied by the asymmetrical relation (or\\nnonrelational tie) of instantiation. If the properties of x\\nare constituents or ontological (proper) parts of x, then\\nx will depend on them in the same way that any whole composed\\nof parts depends on its parts.

Does God command the good because it is good,\\nand forbid the bad because it is bad, or is the good good and the bad\\nbad because God commands/forbids it? If the former, God’s willing\\nwould be subject to an external standard logically antecedent to God\\nto the detriment of the divine sovereignty. If the latter, the content\\nof morality would be arbitrary because subject to God’s free will. On\\nDDS, however, the dilemma is a false alternative. If God is goodness\\nitself in its prime instance, then he is not subject to a standard; he\\nis the standard. And if God, being simple, just is his willing, then\\nhe cannot will anything other than the good and the appearance of\\narbitrarity vanishes.

              "19   \\nOne of the lessons Confucius learned from the ancient texts was the\\nimportance of ruling the people through ethical inspiration rather\\nthan coercion. Many rulers and government ministers in\\nConfucius’s era advocated the use of military power to address\\nexternal threats and strict punishments to deal with internal\\ndisorder. Confucius did not completely dismiss the use of force, but\\nhe regarded it as a last resort, and as ultimately ineffective when\\nused as the primary method of governing. “If you try to guide\\nthe common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with\\npunishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no\\nsense of shame” (Analects 2.3; Slingerland 2003, 8).\\n(We see a similar denigration of the use of brute force in Mencius. In\\na memorable turn of phrase, Mencius warned one ruler that to attempt\\nto conquer the world through warfare is as hopeless as “climbing\\na tree in search of a fish” [1A7].) In place of penal sanctions,\\nConfucius advocated leading the people by moral inspiration and by the\\nsubtle but ubiquitous effect of social mores: “If, however, you\\nguide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the\\npeople will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves”\\n(ibid.). Confucius’s reference to Virtue here reflects the\\nconcept’s political origins. The word we render\\n“Virtue” is “de.” It originally\\nreferred to a sort of political charisma a king accumulated through\\nhis good character and acts of kindness and generosity. Subjects would\\nwillingly follow a ruler with Virtue, without the need for coercion.\\nAlthough Virtue was originally something only a true king could\\npossess, it came to be thought of as an attribute of any person with\\ngood character (i.e., a “virtuous” person), regardless of\\nsocial\\n status.[3]\\n By the end of the Zhou dynasty, it had come to be used as a countable\\nnoun referring to specific virtues, such as benevolence, courage, and\\n wisdom.[4]\\n Although de is thus very close to our concept of virtue, its\\nassociations with royal charisma are distinctive. Consequently, it has\\nbecome conventional to use “Virtue” (with a capital\\n“V”) when translating the specific term\\n“de,” and to use “virtue” (with a\\nlower case “v”) when one needs a generic term for\\nreferring to traits of good character, such as righteousness and\\nloyalty.   \n",

Employing an\\nagricultural metaphor, he refers to these tendencies as\\n“sprouts” (2A6). The sprouts are manifested in cognitive\\nand emotional reactions characteristic of the virtues. For example,\\nall humans feel compassion for the suffering of other humans and\\nanimals, at least on some occasions, and this is a manifestation of\\nbenevolence. Similarly, every person has some things that he or she\\nwould be ashamed to do, or some forms of treatment he or she would\\ndisdain to accept, and these are expressions of righteousness.\\nHowever, as Mencius’s carefully chosen sprout metaphor suggests,\\nhumans are not born with fully formed virtuous dispositions. Our\\nnascent virtues are sporadic and inconsistent in their manifestations.\\nConsequently, a ruler who manifests genuine benevolence when he spares\\nan ox being led to slaughter may nonetheless ignore the suffering of\\nhis own subjects. Likewise, someone who would disdain to be addressed\\ndisrespectfully may feel no compunction in acting against his\\nconvictions in the face of a large bribe. In order to become genuinely\\nvirtuous, a person must “extend” or “fill out”\\nhis or her nascent virtuous inclinations. As Mencius puts it:\\n“People all have things that they will not bear. To extend this\\nreaction to that which they will bear is benevolence. People all have\\nthings that they will not do. To extend this reaction to that which\\nthey will do is righteousness. If people can fill out the heart that\\ndoes not desire to harm others, their benevolence will be\\ninexhaustible. If people can fill out the heart that will not\\ntrespass, their righteousness will be inexhaustible”\\n(Mengzi 7B31; Van Norden 2008, 192). One of the most\\nintriguing issues in Mencius’s philosophy is the proper way to\\nunderstand his claim that we must “extend” (tui, ji,\\nda) or “fill out” (kuo, chong) our innate\\nbut incipient virtuous reactions (1A7, 2A6, 7A15, 7B31).   \n",

One thing he definitely\\nmeant to exclude was that an act can be made right merely by the\\ngoodness of its consequences. He argues (216–17) that this alone\\ncannot be sufficient to constitute an act as right. Take an act whose\\nconsequence will be an increase in someone’s patience, which is\\ngood. If that someone is oneself, one has a duty to do it, Prichard\\nclaims; if it is someone else, one also has a duty to act in that way\\nbut it is a different duty. So the mere goodness of the consequence is\\ninsufficient to render an act a duty. We need also to know what the\\nrelevant ‘definite relation’ is.   \n",

Clearly, God cannot\\nchoose to do evil. But to choose contrary to what is judged to be best\\nis evil or morally wrong only if choosing to do what is judged to be\\nbest is morally obligatory. To claim that it is morally obligatory\\nignores the real possibility that choosing what is best is\\nsupererogatory, beyond the call of duty. There are choices which are\\ngood to make but not required as our duty. It would be a mistake,\\ntherefore, to infer God's inability to choose to act contrary to what\\nhe judges to be best from his inability to choose to do evil.\\nNevertheless, it does seem to be logically impossible for perfect\\ngoodness to choose to act contrary to what is best. And this seems to\\nbe Clarke's own view of the matter. Thus he declares “that\\nthough God is a most perfectly free agent, yet he cannot but do always\\nwhat is best and wisest in the whole” (1738, 120-121). To choose\\notherwise, he thinks, is to act contrary to perfect wisdom and\\ngoodness.   \n",

As is clear, the response depends on an analogy between\\nbeing perfectly powerful (omnipotent) and being perfectly free. His\\nargument can be understood as follows. There are some things God\\ncannot do. He cannot make a square circle. Nor can he choose to do\\nevil. In the first case, his making a square circle is impossible\\nbecause the idea of a square circle is contradictory. In the second\\ncase, the contradiction is in the idea of a perfectly good being\\nchoosing to do evil. Since a contradiction is involved in each case,\\nGod's power is held to extend neither to making a square circle nor to\\nchoosing to do evil. For God's power extends only to what is not\\ncontradictory for a maximally perfect being to do. Clarke then claims\\nthat the fact that God's power does not extend to making a square\\ncircle or choosing to do evil does not imply any diminution of\\npower. And by analogy he infers that it does not imply any diminution\\nof liberty in God.   \n",

Since God necessarily exists and is necessarily\\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good, it seems he would\\nnecessarily be drawn to create the best. If this be so, then when God\\nsurveyed all the possible worlds, he must have chosen the best, with\\nthe result that the actual world is the best of all possible worlds.\\nLeibniz embraced the conclusion of this reasoning: the actual world is\\nthe best of all possible worlds. But how then could God be free in\\nchoosing to create the best? As a first step in the direction of\\nanswering this question, it should be noted that two different views\\nof divine freedom have emerged in western thought. According to the\\nfirst view, God is free in creating a world or in acting within the\\nworld he has created provided nothing outside of him determines him to\\ncreate the world he creates or determines him to act in a particular\\nway in the world he has created. According to the second view, God is\\nfree in creating or acting within his creation provided it was in his\\npower not to create what he did or not to act within his creation as\\nhe did.   \n",

An action was performed freely only if the agent was\\nfree to perform the action and free not to perform it. It must have\\nbeen up to the agent whether to perform or not perform that act. If\\nsome external force or internal passion was beyond the control of the\\nagent, and the agent's action was inevitable given that external force\\nor internal passion, then the agent did not act freely in performing\\nthat action. Since God is a purely rational being and not subject to\\nuncontrollable passions that sometimes compel human agents to act, it\\nis tempting to conclude that God enjoys perfect freedom of action. But\\nthis will be so only if there are no other features in God that both\\nnecessitate his actions and are not within his control. Because human\\nagents are generally thought to have the power to act against the\\ncounsel of reason, we credit their acts due to reason — as\\nopposed to those acts due to irresistible impulses — as acts\\nthey perform freely.  For we believe they were free to reject the\\ncounsel of reason and act otherwise. But what if God cannot reject the\\ncounsel of his reason as to what action to perform? A human agent who\\nis morally good and rational may yet have — or previously had\\n— the power to refrain from acting as his goodness and reason\\ndirect. But can this be true of God?  And, if it cannot be, how can we\\nthen say that God acts freely?   \n",

For\\nwithout such power the agent has no control over her performing an\\naction. It is not up to the agent whether she causes or does not cause\\nher decision and subsequent action. And without such power on God's\\npart with respect to his “creation” of the framework of\\nreality, it makes no sense to thank God or praise God for creating\\nthat eternal framework. Only in some Pickwickian sense could we view\\nGod as “morally responsible” for the creation of the\\nframework of reality. This is not to deny the distinction Morris draws\\nbetween God and the necessary truths constituting the framework of\\nreality. God is causally active in a way in which a necessary truth\\nsuch as Clarke's example — there being innocent beings who do\\nnot suffer eternally is necessarily better than there being innocent\\nbeings who do suffer eternally -is not. But for all Morris says about\\nthe matter, God has no choice but to form the thought that there being\\ninnocent beings who do not suffer eternally is necessarily better than\\nthere being innocent beings who do suffer eternally. And God has no\\nchoice but to acknowledge the truth of this thought. Neither of these\\ndoings on God's part — having that thought, acknowledging its\\ntruth — is any more up to God than it is up to a leaf whether or\\nnot it moves when the wind blows against it. Neither the leaf nor God\\nhas any choice in the matter.   \n",

For Clarke agrees\\nwith Leibniz that often enough the agent has a sufficient reason for\\nher action. So, he allows that PSR is satisfied for a vast array of\\nhuman and divine acts. What he denies is that the sufficient reason\\nfor the agent doing one thing rather than another operates on the\\nagent in the way in which the heavier weight operates on the\\nbalance. Clearly, the heavier weight on one side of the balance is a\\ndetermining cause of the movement of the balance. Given the\\ncircumstances and the placement of that weight on the one side of the\\nbalance, nothing else could happen than what did happen, it was\\nnecessary that the balance move as it did.  But to suppose that the\\nreason or motive that is the sufficient reason for the agent to do one\\nthing rather than another is a determining cause of the agent's act is\\nto deny any power on the agent's part to perform or not perform that\\nparticular act. It is to render the agent's act necessary and to deny\\nthe agent's freedom of will. Thus, for Clarke, a reason or motive may\\nbe the sufficient reason for the agent's action. But, unlike the\\nweight in the balance that is the determining cause of the movement of\\nthe balance, the reason or motive is not the determining cause of the\\nagent's act.

In its\\nnascency, reason is a power that defines itself against an other, an\\nother whose truth and identity is also assigned by reason, thus\\ngiving reason the sense of originating from itself. For Foucault, the\\nissue is that madness is not allowed to speak for itself and is at\\nthe disposal of a power that dictates the terms of their\\nrelationship. As he remarks: “What is originative is the\\ncaesura that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason;\\nreason's subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as\\nmadness, crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this\\npoint” (Foucault 1965, x). The truth of reason is found\\nwhen madness comes to stand in the place of non-reason, when the\\ndifference between them is inscribed in their opposition, but is not\\nidentical to its dominant side. In other words, the reason that\\nstands in opposition to madness is not identical to the reason that\\ninscribes their difference. The latter would be reason without an\\nopposite, a free-floating power without definite shape. As Foucault\\nsuggests, this free-floating mystery might be represented in the ship\\nof fools motif, which, in medieval times, represented madness. Such\\nis the paradoxical structure of historical transformation.   \n",

Boethius\\n(c. 480–524) gave us the definition of the concept of\\n‘person’ that has been fundamental to ethical theory. To\\nunderstand this, we need to go back into the history of the\\ndevelopment of the doctrine of the Trinity. The church had to explain\\nhow the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit could be distinct and yet\\nnot three different gods. They used, in Latin, the\\nterm persona, which means ‘role’ but which was\\nalso used by the grammarians to distinguish what we call ‘first\\nperson, second person and third person’ pronouns and\\nverb-forms. The same human being can be first person ‘I’,\\nsecond person ‘you’, and third person ‘he’ or\\n‘she’, depending on the relations in which he or she\\nstands. The doctrine of the Trinity comes to be understood in terms of\\nthree persons, one God, with the persons standing in different\\nrelations to each other. But then this term ‘person’ is\\nalso used to understand the relation of the second person's divinity\\nto his humanity. The church came to talk about one person with two\\nnatures, the person standing under the natures.

Plato and Aristotle did not have any term that we can\\ntranslate ‘person’ in the modern sense, as\\nsomeone (as opposed to something) that stands under\\nall his or her attributes.

But Anselm, for instance,\\nargues both that God is immutable and that His relations with other\\nthings can change (Monologion 25) and Aquinas does the same (ST Ia 9\\nand 13, 7). So as they understand DDI, it lets God change\\nextrinsically. Suppose that at t, Quine begins to worship\\nGod. Then at t, God comes to have a new relational property,\\nbeing-worshipped-by-Quine. This is clearly an extrinsic change, since\\nits occurring in God implies the existence of someone\\n“outside” God, namely Quine. God does not (let's say) do\\nanything to cause this. It's a matter of Quine's free will. Quine\\ndoesn't do anything to God by worshiping him. And this change in God\\nis a logical parasite of the real changes in Quine which constitute\\nhis beginning to worship God. It's not possible that becoming\\nworshipped by Quine be the only change in a universe. Quine's\\nbeginning to worship must occur too if this one does. DDI thus lets\\nGod become Quine-worshipped. It rules out only real and intrinsic\\nchanges.   \n",

He held that being in time must involve at least two\\nthings which are defects.  For being temporal, as Boethius saw it,\\nentailed having past and future parts of one's life. Temporal beings\\nno longer live the past parts of their lives. They do not yet live the\\nfuture parts of their lives. Both things are defects, according to\\nBoethius. So if God is free of all defects, Boethius reasoned, then\\nGod has no past or future. What has no past or future does not\\nchange. For what changes goes from what it was to what it then was\\ngoing to be, and so has a past and a future. Hence, to Boethius,\\nperfection required changelessness. Necessary perfection — is\\nbetter than contingent perfection, and so by perfect-being reasoning\\nis God's.  If perfection requires changlessness, necessary perfection\\nrequires being immutable. Now Boethius' reasoning requires at least\\nsome cleaning up. For a life could be temporal but lack past or future\\nparts, if it was instantaneous. And if one's past or future are bad,\\nit is not obviously a bad thing not to be living them. But perhaps\\nBoethius' argument has some merit. For it would not be a perfection of\\nan individual to live for only a single temporal instant. Surely\\nlonger would be better, at least if there was a good chance that the\\nlonger existence would be overall good. And if God is truly perfect,\\nHis life, cannot contain parts it is overall bad to live.   \n",

Furthermore, just as there is a built-in bias, as if were, of an\\neffect in relation to its cause in terms of a “turning” to\\nits principle, so all creatures have a bias to return to the source or\\nprinciple of their being. Proposition 147, along with its comment,\\nassures Dietrich that his hierarchy is continuous and that this\\ncontinuity is due solely to the likenesses that exist between the\\nranks of being. But in addition to assimilating the Proclean doctrine\\nof similitude in order to secure continuity of being, Dietrich\\nintroduces his own astonishing principle of linkage in the De\\nintellectu.  There he identifies the operation of a creature with\\nits end. “This operation,” he tells us, “is the end\\nof the thing, for the sake of which the thing exists.” Then he\\ngoes on to reveal how he conceives this operation to link one being\\nwith another: “By means of this operation a thing tends beyond\\nitself. It is due to this operation that there is found in each thing\\nnot only being and truth, but also goodness. Thus each thing is\\ninterchangeably being, true, and good.  Consequently, it is a being\\nwith respect to itself, true as ordered to the intellect, and good\\ninsofar as it actively overflows into something beyond itself.”\\nThis is a remarkable view of operation and end. The operation of a\\ncreature always lies in moving beyond itself and this is its end or\\npurpose. Nothing is static in Dietrich’s universe, everything is\\nmoving, attempting to return to its initial principle.  Creatures do\\nnot have their end in themselves; everything is for the sake of\\nsomething else and that something else is ultimately God.  Insofar as\\na creature follows its proper operation it will be led out of itself\\nand back to God.   \n",

Only secondarily does\\nhe consider the goodness of the desired end of the action. When the\\nwill freely chooses in accordance with right reason only then can the\\nact be considered morally good. Scotus does have some difficulty\\nexplaining the relationship between the will and the intellect. If a\\nhuman being realizes intellectually that the most desirable goal is\\nunion with God, it seems that human intellectual reason would compel\\nhim to pursue such an end. If the will does not act in agreement with\\nthe rationally derived first principle then it must be necessarily\\nwrong. It is thereby difficult to see how the will’s absolute\\nfreedom can be maintained.   \n",

Such a supreme good could never be\\nperceived by practical reason as evil. (S. th. I–II,\\n13, 6 & 10, 2 ad 3; Super ethica, VI, 17, p. 497). The\\ndetermination of the human end as beatitude says very little about the\\nfirst principles of practical reason upon which specific moral\\njudgments should be based. When the will desires, it seems to want\\nmore specific objects than the vague longing for beatitude. Thomas and\\nAlbert specify their theory of volition by means of the doctrines of\\nnatural law, synderesis, and prudence.   \n",

William of Ockham, for\\nexample, despaired of explaining how God could come to know the future\\nfree decisions of the creatures (Shields 1993, 298). Luis de Molina\\ndeveloped the chief rival in classical theism to Aquinas’s\\naccount of the mechanics of omniscience. Molinism has been much\\ndiscussed in recent literature and vigorously defended (Shields &\\nViney 2004, 241, n. 15). Molina claims that there are true statements\\nabout what any possible creature would freely do in any\\nsituation in which that creature existed. The truth of these\\nstatements, called “middle knowledge conditionals,” is\\ndecided by neither God nor the creatures; they are simply eternally\\ntrue, a kind of innate divine knowledge. Molina agrees with Aquinas\\nthat the deity knows the product of its own creative\\nactivity—called “free knowledge” (Kenny 1979, 62).\\nUsing free knowledge, in conjunction with middle knowledge\\nconditionals, God can deduce what any actual creature will freely\\ndo. The deduction has the form: “If individual X\\nwere in situation S, then X would freely decide\\nA” (middle knowledge conditional); and\\n“X is in S” (God’s free\\nknowledge); therefore, “X will freely decide\\nA.” Molina’s theory is designed to save both the\\nfreedom of the creatures and the divine immutability and\\nimpassibility. Thus, it poses as much of a challenge to process theism\\nas does Thomism which claims for itself the same advantages.   \n",

In his account of wisdom in Book One of the\\nMetaphysics, Aristotle argues that knowledge is valued for\\nits own sake. In one place, Aristotle says that what distinguishes\\nexperience (empeiria) from technê is that the\\nlatter has a rational account, which explains what it does. Of course,\\nthe one with experience may be more effective than the inexperienced\\nperson who has only the rational account. Still, we think the\\ncraftsman wiser than the empiric because of his knowledge of the\\naccount (Metaphysics 981a 5–30). The suppressed\\nconclusion is that wisdom is characterized by knowledge of causes\\nquite apart from the utility of knowing the causes. Another argument\\nshows that wisdom is not productive knowledge. Since wonder is the\\nbeginning of philosophy, satisfying that wonder is an end in itself.\\nIn fact, this kind of pursuit arose when the requirements of necessity\\nand ease were satisfied (Metaphysics 982b 10–15). So\\nwisdom is knowledge without practical utility, an end in itself.   \n",

Classic utilitarianism added up the values\\nwithin each part of the consequences to determine which total set of\\nconsequences has the most value in it. One could, instead, aggregate\\ngoods for each individual but not aggregate goods of separate\\nindividuals (Roberts 2002). Or one could give up aggregation\\naltogether and just rank total sets of consequences or total worlds\\ncreated by acts without breaking those worlds down into valuable\\nparts. One motive for this move is Moore’s principle of organic unity\\n(Moore 1903, 27–36), which claims that the value of a combination or “organic unity” of two or more things cannot be calculated simply by adding the values of the things that are combined or unified. For example, even if punishment of a criminal\\ncauses pain, a consequentialist can hold that a world with both the\\ncrime and the punishment is better than a world with the crime but not\\nthe punishment, perhaps because the former contains more\\njustice. Similarly, a world might seem better when people do not get\\npleasures that they do not deserve. Cases like these lead some\\nconsequentialists to deny that moral rightness is any function of the\\nvalues of particular effects of acts. Instead, they compare the whole\\nworld (or total set of consequences) that results from an action with\\nthe whole world that results from not doing that action. If the former\\nis better, then the action is morally right (J.J.C. Smart 1973, 32;\\nFeldman 1997, 17–35). This approach can be called holistic\\nconsequentialism or world utilitarianism.   \n",

One answer is that a formal\\nrelation can be attributed to a person without evaluating the\\nrelation’s components. Strength of will is probably a formal\\nrelation one has to oneself. Very roughly, we might say that a display\\nof strength of will is a particular relation between a person’s\\nintention and corresponding action: it is a matter of acting on an\\nintention given serious obstacles to the action. This is a formal\\nrelation to the self in the sense we are after because we don’t\\nneed to evaluate the appropriateness, value, justice, practical\\nwisdom, and so on, either of the intention or corresponding action in\\norder to identify the whole thing as a case of strength of will. We\\nmight think that all displays of strength of will are valuable, so we\\nmight have certain pro-attitudes to an action simply because it is an\\nattempt to fulfill an intention in the face of serious obstacles. Yet\\nwe don’t need to make this evaluation in order to attribute a\\ndisplay of strength of will to someone. All we need to do is inspect\\nthe correspondence of intention and action given the difficulty of\\nacting on the intention. We don’t need to evaluate whether the\\nintention is directed at anything worthwhile, for example. John\\nBigelow and Robert Pargetter (2007) argue that strength of will is the\\ncore of integrity (and that alternative conceptions of integrity tend\\nto confuse integrity with authenticity). The self-integration account\\nof integrity takes this formal characterization of integrity a step\\nfurther. Self-integration is an achievement rather than a quality or\\ndisposition such as strength of will — though strength of will\\nis likely to be an important quality in those who achieve\\nself-integration. Self-integration still represents a formal account\\nof integrity. In attributing self-integration to a person we are\\nmaking no evaluative judgement of the states that are integrated\\nwithin the person.   \n",

The power to suspend is the power\\nto keep one’s will from being determined, that is, the power to\\nforbear willing to do A if one wills to forbear willing to\\ndo A. This is just one part of the freedom to will to\\ndo A, according to Locke’s definition of freedom of\\naction applied to the action of willing to do A. (The other\\npart is the power to will to do A if one wills to will to\\ndo A.) Thus if, as Locke seems to argue in II.xxi.23–24,\\nwe are (except under very unusual circumstances) free with respect to\\nthe act of willing with respect to a future course of action, then it\\nfollows immediately that we have the power to suspend. Locke’s\\nclaims about the power to suspend being the source of all liberty and\\nthe hinge on which liberty turns can be understood as claims that the\\npower to suspend is a particularly important aspect of freedom of\\naction as applied to the action of willing. What makes it important is\\nthe fact that it is the misuse of this freedom that accounts for our\\nresponsibility for actions that conduce to our own unhappiness or\\nmisery.   \n",

Since one is free\\nto the extent that one is externally unprevented from doing things,\\nthey say, one can be free to do what one does not desire to do. If\\nbeing free meant being unprevented from realizing one’s desires,\\nthen one could, again paradoxically, reduce one’s unfreedom by\\ncoming to desire fewer of the things one is unfree to do. One could\\nbecome free simply by contenting oneself with one’s situation. A\\nperfectly contented slave is perfectly free to realize all of her\\ndesires. Nevertheless, we tend to think of slavery as the opposite of\\nfreedom. More generally, freedom is not to be confused with happiness,\\nfor in logical terms there is nothing to stop a free person from being\\nunhappy or an unfree person from being happy. The happy person might\\nfeel free, but whether they are free is another\\nmatter (Day, 1970). Negative theorists of freedom therefore tend to\\nsay not that having freedom means being unprevented from doing as one\\ndesires, but that it means being unprevented from doing whatever one\\nmight desire to do (Steiner 1994. Cf. Van Parijs 1995; Sugden\\n2006).   \n",

In this broad sense,\\nimpartiality is probably best characterized in a negative rather than\\npositive manner: an impartial choice is simply one in which a certain\\nsort of consideration (i.e. some property of the individuals being\\nchosen between) has no influence. An analysis along these lines has\\nbeen proposed by Bernard Gert, who holds that “A is\\nimpartial in respect R with regard to group G if and\\nonly if A’s actions in respect R are not\\ninfluenced at all by which member(s) of G benefit or are\\nharmed by these actions” (Gert 1995, 104). Thus, for Gert,\\nimpartiality is a property of a set of decisions made by a particular\\nagent, directed toward a particular group.   \n",

Furnished with\\nsense organs that in some cases are superior to those of humans,\\nanimals are able to achieve wondrous and ingenious things; they adopt\\nforms of collective organization; they know how to make use of medical\\nand military arts; moreover, they are endowed with a form of\\nreasoning, of language, of natural prophecy and even of religion.\\nThese analogies should not, however, obscure or cast doubt on the\\nexcellence of the human condition. Humans are furnished with a\\nspiritus that is far more refined and pure than that of\\nanimals; it is able to move with agility within more spacious brain\\ncells, enabling humans to develop more complex chains of argument. The\\nauthentic and radical difference between animals and humans, however,\\nconsists in the fact that the latter are endowed, not only with a\\nspiritus, but also with an immaterial mens (mind) of\\ndivine origin, that constitutes and is the basis of their specific\\nmakeup. Humans do not exhaust all their capacities within the frame of\\nthe natural world. They can project themselves by means of thought and\\ndesire toward the infinite. They are able to go beyond the limits of\\nnatural self-preservation and turn themselves toward higher goods and\\nends. Above all, humans are free. In contrast to what happens to\\nanimals, who are unable to disengage themselves from the demands of\\nthe senses, humans can repel the compulsion of the passions in order\\nto make choices that go beyond simple practical advantage and the\\nimmediate satisfaction of needs. Humans can resist the siren song, as\\ndid Ulysses who tied himself to the stake of reason.   \n",

There he devoted his energies to the\\npublication of his works, bringing out a new edition of the\\nPhilosophia realis in four parts, accompanied by\\nquaestiones; reprints of De sensu rerum and of\\nAtheismus triumphatus; Philosophia rationalis in\\nfive parts (Dialectica, Grammatica, Rhetorica,\\nPoetica and Historiographia); and, above all, the\\nMetaphysica, which he described with legitimate pride in the\\ndedicatory letter as the “philosophers’ bible.” This is a\\nvast and complex work, in which the most important themes of his\\nthought come together and in which he sets out the doctrine of the\\n“primalities” (primalitates), the constituent\\nprinciples of the Supreme Being and of all other created beings. God,\\nthe first infinite cause, has his essence in the principles of Power,\\nWisdom and Love in an infinite manner. Every finite being is composed\\nof these same primalities but in ways and proportions that are limited\\nand differentiated. Nothingness does not exist either in God or\\noutside of him; but he makes use of it to construct the finiteness and\\nthe distinctiveness of entities. After the explanation of the doctrine\\nof the primalities comes that of the three great influences:\\nNecessity, Fate and Harmony, the vehicles by which the divine Idea, in\\nall its infinite degrees, is conveyed to the world and to matter. In\\nthe light of these doctrines, Campanella re-examines fundamental\\nissues such as the relationship between necessity and contingency and\\nbetween human freedom, fate and providence, as well as problems\\nconcerning evil and sin.   \n",

Yet one virtue in particular reigns supreme and\\ncontains all the others, and that virtue is justice, which Leibniz\\ndefines as the “charity of the wise man” (PW, “Codex\\nIuris Gentium,” p. 171; cf. PW, p. 57 & p. 83). One whose\\nlove is guided by wisdom possesses the charity of the wise. Love is\\nthe pleasure one takes in the happiness and perfection of others (PW,\\n“Felicity,” §5; NE, p. 163). God's wisdom is infinite\\nand His love is universal, extending to all beings capable of\\nhappiness. God's universal benevolence, Leibniz suggests, is an ideal\\nwe ought to do our best to imitate and continuously aspire to (PW,\\n“Meditation on the Common Concept of Justice”, pp.\\n57–8; cf. PE, “Principles of Nature and Grace, Based on\\nReason,” §14, pp. 211–12). The more one's benevolence\\nexpands to encompass the happiness of more and more others, the more\\none grows in justice and virtue, thereby increasing in moral goodness\\n(for further reading on Leibniz's view of justice as the charity of\\nthe wise, see Riley 1996 (Chapter 4) and 2003).   \n",

The essay drew a sharp response from\\nXiang Xiu, for whom desire arises naturally from the mind. As such, it\\ncannot be eradicated but only regulated by rules of propriety and\\nritual action. In reply, Ji Kang points out that although pleasure and\\nanger, and the desire for fame and beauty may stem from the self, like\\na tumor they only serve to deplete one’s qi. Basic\\nneeds are of course not to be denied, but desires are shaped by\\nobjects and reflect cognitive distortions that consume the self. To\\nquench one’s thirst, one does not desire to drink the whole\\nriver. This is fundamentally different from the desire for power and\\nwealth, which knows no rest. Moreover, the suppression of desire by\\nartificial means may remove certain symptoms, but it does not cure the\\ndisease. It is only by recognizing the harmful influences of desire\\nthat one begins to seek calmness and emptiness of mind. Ultimately,\\nnourishing life is not just about health and longevity but sets its\\nsight on a higher, and to Ji Kang, more authentic, mode of being\\ncharacterized by dispassion.   \n",

The veil puzzles Fanon and challenges his deepest\\npolitical commitment: postcoloniality means an embrace of the\\nnew. Revolution is absolute and radical, marking a break with the\\npast rather than a return to a different version of the past. The\\nfuture is the future, and so full of the unprecedented. What does that\\nmean for traditions that have been suppressed by colonial rule, for\\nexample the veil in Islamic cultural practice? In his work on\\nblackness, Fanon was quite clear that a return to African\\ncivilization—the imperative of the Négritude\\nmovement—represents a mirage and only doubles the loss of the\\npast by losing black people in an illusion. But that is not the case\\nwith his treatment of Islamic traditions in Algeria and other parts of\\nthe Maghreb. The suppression of those traditions, on Fanon’s\\naccount, marginalize or push tradition into secret—or, perhaps,\\nkeep the tradition in the open, but always as backward, abject, and\\ncontrary to modernity. This means tradition is still alive, not a\\nmirage, and as alive also valued deeply by communities resisting\\ncolonial rule. Such traditions can be instrumentalized for the sake of\\nrevolutionary action, only to be evaluated after colonialism\\nfor their suitability in a postcolonial nation and culture. The same\\nlogic is elaborated in “The Algerian Family”, where Fanon\\nexplores the traditional structure of families in Algeria, in\\nparticular how those families set gender identity, power, marriage,\\nand reproduction in fixed roles. Revolutionary families, he argues,\\nidentify these fixed roles and break with them while also\\nmaintaining a conviction that their practices are Algerian—that\\nis, Algerian in the new sense.   \n",

This is because the will is a kind of\\ncause—willing causes action. Kant took from Hume the idea that\\ncausation implies universal regularities: if x causes\\ny, then there is some universally valid law connecting\\nXs to Ys. So, if my will is the cause of my\\nφing, then Φing is connected to the sort of willing I engage\\nin by some universal law. But it can’t be a natural law, such as\\na psychological, physical, chemical or biological law. These laws,\\nwhich Kant thought were universal too, govern the movements of my\\nbody, the workings of my brain and nervous system and the operation of\\nmy environment and its effects on me as a material being. But they\\ncannot be the laws governing the operation of my will; that, Kant\\nalready argued, is inconsistent with the freedom of my will in a\\nnegative sense. So, the will operates according to a universal law,\\nthough not one authored by nature, but one of which I am the origin or\\nauthor. And that is to say that, in viewing my willing to φ as a\\nnegatively free cause of my φing, I must view my will as the\\nautonomous cause of my having φed, as causing my having φed by\\nway of some law that I, insofar as I am a rational will, laid down for\\nmy will.   \n",

Consider how\\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making — created\\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\\ninternal to “the will of the people.” It is because the\\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\\nKant’s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\\nsuch a principle. Hence, the “moral legitimacy” of the CI\\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person’s own\\nrational will. It is because each person’s own reason is the\\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).   \n",

Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint\\non their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human\\nbeings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral\\nLaw is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A\\nholy or divine will, if it exists, though good,\\nwould not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because\\nsuch a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily\\nfulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It\\nis the presence of desires that could operate independently\\nof moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an\\nessential element of the idea of “duty.” So in analyzing\\nunqualified goodness as it occurs in imperfectly rational creatures\\nsuch as ourselves, we are investigating the idea of being motivated by\\nthe thought that we are constrained to act in certain ways that we\\nmight not want to simply from the thought that we are morally\\nrequired to do so.   \n",

Rather, God freely subordinated his own actions to the\\nobtainment of certain specific conditions, namely, certain states of\\nnatural beings or of human minds. Sturm does not extensively use the\\nMalebranchian terminology of occasional causes, but he does explicitly\\nequate occasional causes with sine quibus non causes (PE I:\\n117). A sine qua non cause is a (counterfactually) necessary\\ncondition for the production of a certain effect, although the\\nsine qua non cause does not truly contribute to its\\nproduction in virtue of any active power it possesses (see Sangiacomo\\n2019). Sturm’s account of God’s hypothetical power entails\\nthat all natural forms are sine quibus non conditions for the\\nproduction of natural effects, in the sense that they do not\\ncontribute in virtue of any active power they might have (since they\\nhave none), but rather because God (freely) established to bring about\\ncertain effects as consequences of certain modifications (i.e., forms)\\nof matter. Since (what Malebranche calls) ‘occasional\\ncauses’ can be understood in terms of sine qua non\\ncausation, and since Sturm maintains that all natural forms work as\\nsine quibus non causes of natural effects, it seems safe to\\nconclude that Sturm supports a version of occasionalism.   \n",

In the fourth Book of his\\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\\n(epithumêtikon). This terminology was also used by\\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\\nand concupiscibilis. Plato’s view of emotions was\\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\\naction-initiating impulses. Plato’s main reason for this\\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression.    \n",

The most relevant in this connection are\\nsensory moving powers and internal senses: common sense, imagery\\n(retention of sensations), estimation, memory, and imagination\\n(separation and combination of sensory forms). Inner senses are\\nnon-perceptual apprehensive powers of the sensory soul (De\\nanima IV.1, 1–11; IV.3, 37–40). The moving power of\\nthe sensory soul is divided into a commanding power and an executive\\npower, the former of which is the center of emotions. The executive\\nmoving power operates through the nervous system and the muscles. It\\nis moved by the commanding moving power, the acts of which are\\ntriggered by an occurrent evaluation of estimative power and\\naccompanied by bodily affections as well as behavioral changes,\\nprovided that the executive moving power is also actualized. If the\\ncommanding act is strong enough, the executive power is necessarily\\nactualized in animals, but not so in humans because they can prevent\\nthe impulse of the executive moving power by their will. The will is\\nthe moving power of the immaterial intellectual soul. Together with\\npractical intellect, it should control the emotions (De anima\\nI.5, 94; IV.4, 54–56, 59).   \n",

Because free will was the center of personality in voluntarist\\ntheory, attending to its non-efficacious likings and dislike was an\\naspect of morally relevant self-awareness; one should not merely\\ncontrol the intentions to act but also non-efficacious likings and\\ndislikes in general. These were directly voluntary and the passions of\\nthe will were indirectly so; both had a motivational role in moral\\nbehavior.

If one is going to\\nconstruct an explanatory hypothesis using the criterion of simplicity,\\nGod rather than science is more likely to be the focus of the true\\nexplanatory hypothesis. God is one and of one kind; polytheism is\\nruled out. Moreover, God is the simplest kind of person there can be\\nbecause a person is a being with power (to do intentional actions),\\nknowledge, and freedom (to choose, uncaused, which actions to do), and\\nin God these properties are infinite, and having infinite properties\\nis simpler than having properties with limits, as humans do. “It\\nis always simpler to postulate infinite or zero degrees of some\\nproperty than a certain precise finite value of it” (Swinburne\\n1983: 385). Furthermore, God engages in simple causation, that is,\\ncausation by simple intention. Swinburne concludes that although the\\nprior likelihood of neither God nor the universe is particularly high,\\nthe prior probability of a simple God exceeds that of a complex\\nuniverse. Hence, if anything is to occur unexplained, it would be God,\\nnot the universe.   \n",

That is, from God’s\\nnecessary existence we can conclude that the pluriverse necessarily\\nexists. This avoids the van Inwagen objection to the PSR as employed\\nin the cosmological argument. Almeida holds that it also avoids the\\nother problems associated with the cosmological argument in that it\\nallows for contingency within absolute explanation. He contends that\\ncontingency is protected by lowering the standards of similarity\\nbetween worlds; that is, contingency is possible where we do not\\nrequire exact identity between things held to exist in different\\nworlds. He gives the example of his speaking Finnish, something he\\ncannot do in the actual world. If someone who is identical to Almeida\\nexists in another world, metaphysically he must have identical\\nproperties. However, it makes sense to say that in another possible\\nworld Almeida could speak Finnish and still be Almeida. We lower the\\nstandards of similarity in our everyday consideration of existence in\\nalternate worlds to allow for such possibilities and hence for the\\ncontingency of his not speaking Finnish in the actual world.   \n",

The content of lovingkindness is a wish for\\nothers to be happy. Lovingkindness, which can be a very enjoyable\\nstate, is a kind of opening to others and to the reality of their\\nlives. The content of compassion is a wish for others to be free from\\nsuffering. This quality makes it possible to be fully aware and\\npresent in the face of others’ suffering.

For it appears to be a conceptual truth\\nthat God is unsurpassable. If he is, then, if there were two gods each\\nwould be unsurpassable. But there can’t be two unsurpassable beings\\neach of which is God. For part of what it means to call\\nsomething “God” is that it is an appropriate object of\\ntotal devotion and unconditional commitment. If there were two\\nunsurpassable beings, however, our devotion and commitment should be\\ndivided between them. (As Scotus says, if there were two infinite\\ngoods, “an orderly will … could not be perfectly satisfied\\nwith but one infinite good” [Scotus, 87].) Since they are equally\\nperfect, it would be inappropriate to be totally devoted or\\nunconditionally committed to either one of them. But if it\\nwould, then neither of them would be God. So if it is a conceptual\\ntruth that God is unsurpassable, he must be unique.   \n",

For Numenius functions of this kind,\\nsuch as perception, memory, and desire, are not essential to the soul\\nand are later additions to it (fr. 43.7–9), coming into\\nexistence with its embodiment. Numenius apparently held that the human\\nsoul is an intellect that descended to human bodies through the\\nplanets (fr.  12.14–16). This is a view that also Celsus shared\\n(Origen, Against Celsus VI.21; see Frede 1994, 5211), which\\nwe can find also in Hermetic treatises (Corpus Hermeticum. I.25;\\nDodds 1960, 8). Furthermore, Origen also adopts the view that the\\nhuman soul is essentially an intellect that falls in bodies and then\\nbecomes a soul with the necessary faculties to operate within a human\\nbody, yet the soul retains the ability to ascend and become an\\nintellect again (On Principles I.4.1, I.8.1, II.6.4,\\nII.9.7). Numenius arrives at this view guided by the analogy of the\\nCave and the story of Er in Republic VII and X respectively,\\nbut also by the description of the creation of the soul in\\nthe Timaeus (41e), according to which the demiurge mounts the\\nsouls on vehicles (ochêmata). Porphyry in his\\nwork The Cave of Nymphs makes clear that he relies on\\nNumenius' exegesis of the soul's descent to bodies through the planets\\n(frs. 30–33) and speaks of the honey offered by the astrologists\\nin anticipation of the future pleasures of the souls in earth\\n(fr. 32). Apparently pleasures draw the soul towards the earth and\\nalso keep it attached to it.   \n",

That\\nis why the law is not dependent on time and place but tries to\\nestablish a standard that is absolute and universal. To take a modern\\nexample, the law prescribes a limit to the amount of alcohol a person\\ncan have in his blood and still be able to drive. Undoubtedly there are\\nvariations among individuals that allow one person with a certain\\namount of alcohol to be much more alert than another.

We then recognize that it is impossible for\\nthere to be an infinite body or an infinite number of finite bodies. So\\nevery corporeal thing is finite. If it is finite, it can only contain a\\nfinite amount of power. If it can only contain a finite amount of\\npower, it can only explain motion over a finite period of time. Because\\nthe heavenly bodies are always moving, the only thing that can explain\\nthat motion is an infinite power. Because an infinite power cannot be\\ncontained in a finite thing, it cannot be corporeal. If it is not\\ncorporeal, it is not subject to division or change. Seeing that its\\npower is infinite, it cannot derive that power from something else.\\nThus the only way to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies is to\\nposit the existence of a being that is neither a body nor a force in a\\nbody.   \n",

Not\\nsurprisingly, however, he replaces the Stoic logos with the\\nChristian logos or “Word of God” from the Gospel\\nof St John. Our own individual natures, as parts of nature or God,\\nfunction in the same way as do souls in the human body: they are God\\ndwelling in the human frame (Manuductio II.19). By\\nidentifying the Stoic logos with the Christian God, Lipsius\\nis able to conclude, along with Cicero and Clement of Alexandria, that\\nthe Stoic supreme good is equivalent to faith in God. Virtue and\\nwisdom come from the source of all knowledge: God. The Platonic\\ncontemplation of the Good and the Stoic exploration of the\\nrelationship of individual to universal nature are both tantamount to\\nthe study of God and his logos, Christ. Therefore, the virtue\\nwhich the Stoics regard as the summum bonum is the right\\nattitude towards God; and this virtue is the only way to achieve the\\ngood life (Manuductio II.19).   \n",

At the heart of this\\ntheory is the notion of a game of make-believe (see the SEP entry on\\n imagination\\n for further discussion). We play such a game if, for instance, when\\nwalking through a forest we imagine that stumps are bears and if we\\nspot a stump we imagine that we spot a bear. In Walton’s\\nterminology the stumps are props, and the rule that we\\nimagine a bear when we see a stump is a principle of\\ngeneration. Together a prop and principle of generation prescribe\\nwhat is to be imagined. Walton considers a vast variety of different\\nprops, including statues and works of literary fiction. Toon focuses\\non the particular kind of game in which we are prescribed to imagine\\nsomething of a real world object. A statue showing Napoleon on\\nhorseback (Toon 2012: 37) is a prop mandating us to imagine, for\\ninstance, that Napoleon has a certain physiognomy and certain facial\\nexpressions. When reading The War of the Worlds (2012: 39) we\\nare prescribed to imagine that the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral\\nhas been attacked by aliens and now has a gaping hole on its western\\nside.   \n",

The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\\n“primacy of essence” should be attributed to\\nvoluntas, whereas “primacy of action” should be\\nattributed to ratio.   \n",

More\\nprecisely, esse essentiae belongs to essence because of its\\neternal relation with God as formal cause. It is only in virtue of this\\nrelation that essences can also come into actual existence, which\\nsignals a new relation between a creature and God, the latter now as\\nefficient cause. In the first case, essences depend on the divine\\nintellect, in the second, on the divine will. Being therefore always\\nindicates a relation in creatures, which is simple for essences in\\nthemselves (esse essentiae), and twofold for actualized\\nessences (esse essentiae plus esse existentiae).\\nNevertheless the two types of relation are not perfectly symmetrical.\\nIn the first place, while essence can be conceived independently of its\\nexistence in the physical world, it cannot be conceived independently\\nof its being-essence, otherwise it would be a mere figment.\\nConsequently, the relation that forges esse existentiae is in\\nsome way accidental, whereas that which forges esse essentiae\\nis essential. In the second place, since God chooses, from all the\\nessences eternally constituted as such by His intellect, those that He\\nwill actualize over time, on the basis of His free will, one\\nrespectus is such from eternity, while the other takes place\\nin time.   \n",

In a letter to Sophie Charlotte, Leibniz writes:\\n“So that even in our instinctive or involuntary actions, where\\nit seems only the body plays a part, there is in the soul an appetite\\nfor good or an aversion to evil which directs it, even though our\\nreflection is not able to pick it out in the confusion” (GP III,\\n347; WF 224f.). Nor does Leibniz restrict final causation to rational\\nagents. (Nor does Aristotle for that matter.) The final cause of a\\nplant or an animal is not a plan or intention. Rather, it is whatever\\nlies at the end of the regular series of developmental changes that it\\nundergoes.    \n",

What is required in addition is only a principle strong\\nenough to justify the unity. He thinks to have found it in what we\\ncould call ‘the principle of ordination’: a substance can be composite\\nand nevertheless one when the essentially different parts are ordered\\nto each other (ad invicem), from the less to the more\\ncomplete. A human being has “one form which is not simple\\n(simplex) but a composite of many [potentiae] having\\na natural order to each other” (E 7,\\n 53).[4]\\n These forms are organized in a hierarchical structure so that\\nthere is one which is the perfection of the whole composite.

William treats such possibles as in some sense prior to\\nbeing. In the case of those that have being and thus actually exist, he\\nholds that the possible “and its being (esse), which\\ndoes not belong to it essentially, are really two. The one comes to the\\nother and does not fall within its definition or quiddity. Being\\n(ens) [i.e., a being] in this way is, therefore, composite and\\nalso resolvable into its possibility, or quiddity, and its being\\n(esse)” (Switalski 1976, 44; Wade and Teske, 87). Some\\ncommentators see in such remarks the idea that a real or\\nmind-independent distinction obtains between being and essence in\\npossible beings.   \n",

Such a being\\nis said to participate in or acquire its being. At times William,\\nfollowing Avicenna, speaks of its being as accidental to it. He terms\\nthe being (esse) possessed by a being by participation as\\nbeing by participation.   \n",

Virtue reduces the potential for conflict to harmony. The master\\nvirtue, justice, is each part doing its function and not interfering\\nwith that of another (441d–e; 443d). Since the function of\\nreason is to exercise forethought for the whole soul, it should rule.\\nThe appetites, which seek only their immediate satisfaction, should\\nnot rule. A soul ruled by appetites is the very picture of\\npsychological injustice. Still, to fulfill its function of ruling,\\nreason needs wisdom, the knowledge of what is beneficial for each of\\nthe parts of the soul and for the whole. Moderation is a harmony among\\nthe parts based on agreement that reason should rule. Courage is the\\nspirited part carrying out the decrees of reason about what is to be\\nfeared (442b–d). Any attentive reader of the dialogues must feel\\nthat Socrates has now given an answer to the questions that started\\nmany of the aporetic dialogues. At this point, we have the fully\\ndeveloped moral psychology that allows the definition of the moral\\nvirtues. They fall into place around the tripartite structure of the\\nsoul.   \n",

Toward the end of the book, Socrates\\nconducts a three-part contest to show the philosophical, or\\naristocratic, man is the happiest. In the second of these contests, he\\nclaims that each part of the soul has its peculiar desire and\\ncorresponding pleasure. Reason, for instance, desires to learn;\\nsatisfying that desire is a pleasure distinct from the pleasure, e.g.,\\nof eating (580d–e). One can now see that the functions of each\\nof the parts has a new, affective dimension. Then, in the last of the\\ncontests, Socrates makes an ontological distinction between true\\npleasure of the soul and less true pleasure of the body. The former is\\nthe pleasure of knowing being, i.e., the forms, and the latter is the\\npleasure of filling bodily appetite. The less true pleasures also give\\nrise to illusions and phantoms of pleasure; these illusions and\\nphantoms recall the images and shadows in the allegory of the cave\\n(583b–586c). Clearly, then, distinctions from the metaphysics\\nand epistemology of the central books are being made relevant to the\\ndivisions within the soul. Pleasures of reason are on a higher\\nontological level than those of the bodily appetites; this difference\\ncalls for a modification of the definitions of the virtues from Book\\nIV. For instance, in Book IV, justice is each part fulfilling its own\\nfunction; in Book IX, that function is specified in terms of the kinds\\nof pleasure each part pursues. Reason pursues the true pleasure of\\nknowing and the appetites the less true pleasure of the body. Appetite\\ncommits injustice if it pursues pleasure not proper to it, i.e., if it\\npursues bodily pleasures as though they were true pleasures\\n(586d–587a). The result is an account of virtue which\\ndiscriminates among pleasures, as any virtue ethics should; but the\\ncriterion of discrimination reflects the distinction between being and\\nbecoming. Rational pleasures are more real than bodily pleasures,\\nalthough bodily pleasures are not negligible. Happiness, in turn,\\nintegrates the virtue of managing bodily appetites and pleasures with\\nthe pleasures of learning, but definitely gives greater weight to the\\nlatter.   \n",

He\\nargues that it has three parts, each corresponding to one of the\\nclasses in the city. At this point, we should note the difficulty of\\ntalking about parts of the soul. In making his argument about conflict\\nin the soul, Socrates does not usually use a word that easily\\ncorresponds to the English ‘part.’ Sometimes he uses\\n‘form’ (eidos) and ‘kind’\\n(genos) (435b–c), other times a periphrasis such as\\n‘that in the soul that calculates’ (439d–e),\\nalthough in the subsequent account of virtue, we do find\\nmeros, which means part (442b–d). So, insofar as\\nvocabulary is concerned, one should be cautious about taking the\\nsubdivisions of the soul to be independent agents. Perhaps the least\\nmisleading way of thinking about the parts is as distinct functions.\\nReason is the function of calculating, especially about what is good\\nfor the soul. The appetites for food, drink, and sex are like the\\nproducing class – they are necessary for bodily existence\\n(439c–e). These two parts are familiar to the modern reader, who\\nwill recognize the psychological capacity for reasoning and\\ncalculating, on the one hand, and the bodily desires, on the other.\\nLess familiar is the part of the soul that corresponds to the\\nauxiliaries, the military class. This is the spirited part\\n(thymos or thymoeides). Associated with the heart,\\nit is an aggressive drive concerned with honor. Thumos is\\nmanifested as anger with those who attack one’s honor. Perhaps\\nmore importantly, it is manifested as anger with oneself when failing\\nto do what one knows he should do (439e–440d).   \n",

(The generic\\n‘ought’ is fine.) These concepts, Anscombe argues, have a\\npoint only in a law-based ethics: if a moral legislator (e.g. God)\\ncommands you to do something, then you have a moral obligation or\\nmoral duty to do it. But in forms of ethics not based upon such a\\nlegislator, talk about moral obligation or moral duty is akin to those\\narguing about what is criminal in a society lacking criminal law or\\ncourts, or, alternatively, to castaways talking about whether their\\nclothing accords with the new company policy – the necessary\\nsocial framework for making such talk meaningful is absent. Unlike J.\\nL. Mackie, who thought that moral thought and talk was false, Anscombe\\nargued that it was nonsense, which is probably worse. She held that\\nethicists would do better to classify actions instead as, say,\\ntruthful or untruthful, just or unjust, … rather than as\\nmorally right or morally wrong.   \n",

All created\\nbeings have the potential to increase in perfection. Perfectibility is\\ngrounded in divine goodness, and made possible by the mutability of\\ncreated things. Holding to the Platonic conception of goodness as\\ngodlikeness, Conway argues that since all creatures have some\\nresemblance to God, all creatures are endowed with a capacity for\\ngood, and an impulse to strive for greater good (“continual\\nmotion or operation, which most certainly strives for their further\\ngood”; Principles VI.6). Everything is thus\\nperfectible, with the potential to increase in goodness, even beyond\\nits original state in its first creation, ad infinitum. But\\nnothing can become infinitely good, because then it would become\\nGod.   \n",

To die is to stand vis-à-vis the\\nabsolute. In the discussion of the “I-You” relation, this\\nterm appeared as the absolute other in one’s interior; here it shifts\\nto the absolute in contradistinction to finite beings. Nishida calls\\nit God as well, but makes clear that he is not referring to a\\npersonal, transcendent being. If transcendence is involved, it is a\\ngoing beyond by going within. He also implies that it is not\\nsynonymous with absolute nothingness. If relative nothingness as opposed to\\nbeing is implied, it is in the verbal sense of self-negating. The\\nabsolute “lives” through its own self-negation and inclusion of the\\nrelative self. It does not die in the sense that relative beings do,\\nfor it embraces all others whereas they, by being individual, exclude\\nothers. God cannot be wholly transcendent to or exclusive of the\\nself or the world. Even Nishida’s early work, An Inquiry Into the\\nGood , had spoken of God in a way that undermined the notion of a\\ntranscendent being outside the world; it conceived of God as the\\ninfinite activity of unification at work behind the articulations of\\nspirit and nature out of pure experience.   \n",

But then there is\\nnothing to constitute its motion: an infinite number of zero motions\\ndoes not add up to anything but zero motion. In response to the reply\\nthat according to measure theory a (nondenumerably) infinite number\\nof points of measure zero can have a non-zero measure, Priest argues\\nthat this is just mathematics: “…it does not ease the\\ndiscomfort … when one tries to understand how the arrow actually\\nachieves its motion. At any point in its motion it advances not at\\nall. Yet in some apparently magical way, in a collection of these it\\nadvances. Now a sum of nothings, even infinitely many nothings, is\\nnothing.

It is important to see that on such a view, moral evil is not\\ntreated as a causal means to the good of our having friendship with\\nGod. If that were so, opponents could justly object that God could\\nsimply have created us in such friendship from the start, and the\\ndefense would fail. Rather, the good on which this kind of theodicy is\\nbased is a free and informed choice that can only be made from a\\nposition of sinfulness. Rather than constituting a causal\\nmeans to our establishing our own stance toward God, sin is\\nan indispensable part of the process — something\\nwithout which a legitimate choice for or against God’s\\nfriendship is not just causally but conceptually impossible. But that\\nis not all. In the case of those who choose in God’s favor, at\\nleast, moral evil is defeated in that it is bound up in a\\ntotal state of affairs that counts as a far greater good, in which the\\nevil is addressed and overcome. The very autonomy that the sinner once\\ninsisted upon is surrendered to God, thus becoming the foundation for\\na new understanding and a richer relationship, in which one is able to\\nact as an informed and wholehearted participant in the divine\\nenterprise of working good. Sin does not function as a causal means in\\nthis process, nor is it simply overbalanced by some other good with\\nwhich it coexists. It encountered and overcome, through the\\nprovidential operation of God, as manifested in creaturely\\nfreedom.   \n",

A link is\\ndetermined by its type (tensor or cotensor), its premises (a sequence\\nP1,…,Pn, 0\\n≤ n), its conclusions (a\\nsequence C1,…,Cm, 0\\n≤ m), and its main formula (which can be empty, in the\\ncase of a neutral link, or one of the Pi\\nor Ci). A proof structure is a set of\\nlinks over a finite set of formulas such that every formula is at most\\nonce the premise of a link and at most once the conclusion.  Formulas\\nwhich are not the conclusion of any link are the hypotheses\\nof the proof structures, whereas the formulas which are not the\\npremise of any link are the conclusions.  An axiom formula is\\na formula which is not the main formula of any\\nlink.  Abstract proof structures are obtained by erasing all\\nformulas on the internal nodes. A proof net is a proof\\nstructure for which the abstract proof structure converts to a tensor\\ntree — a rooted tree in the case of the intuitionistic systems,\\npossibly an unrooted tree in the case of symmetric LG.

This parallels the Catholic belief in the limited\\npower of free will. Without divine guidance human endeavours are in\\nvain. Similarly the successful education of children depends on the\\nguidance of parents and teachers, father figures recalling God’s\\npatriarchal model.   \n",

First, because the determinations\\nin the moment of understanding sublate themselves,\\nHegel’s dialectics does not require some new idea to show up\\narbitrarily. Instead, the movement to new determinations is driven by\\nthe nature of the earlier determinations and so “comes about on\\nits own accord” (PhG-P §79). Indeed, for Hegel, the\\nmovement is driven by necessity (see, e.g., EL Remarks to\\n§§12, 42, 81, 87, 88; PhG §79). The natures of the\\ndeterminations themselves drive or force them to pass into\\ntheir opposites. This sense of necessity—the idea that\\nthe method involves being forced from earlier moments to later\\nones—leads Hegel to regard his dialectics as a kind of\\nlogic. As he says in the Phenomenology, the\\nmethod’s “proper exposition belongs to logic” (PhG-M\\n§48). Necessity—the sense of being driven or forced to\\nconclusions—is the hallmark of “logic” in Western\\nphilosophy.   \n",

This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.   \n",

For example, in some places Descartes identifies things as\\nhaving possible existence to highlight that they are dependent\\ncreatures, and creatures whose existence cannot be read straight from\\ntheir concept. To describe the kind of existence had by finite\\ncreatures generally, he uses ‘possible existence’ and\\n‘contingent existence’ interchangeably: he sometimes\\nspeaks of the beings that depend on God for their existence as having\\n“possible or contingent existence” (Second\\nReplies, AT 7:166, CSM 2:117; Notae, AT 8B:361, CSM\\n1:306), and sometimes he speaks of them as having just\\n“contingent existence” (Principles I.15, AT\\n8A:10, CSM 1:198). When he says that creatures have possible\\nor contingent existence, he identifies the two kinds of\\nexistence: “possible or [vel] contingent\\nexistence.” If contingent existence is just the kind of\\nexistence had by beings that depend for their existence on God’s\\nwill and whose existence cannot be established by an analysis of their\\nconcept alone (Fifth Meditation, AT 7:63–66, CSM 2:44–46;\\nRules for the Direction of the Mind, AT 10:421–22, CSM\\n1:45–46), then the fact that a thing has possible existence in\\nDescartes’ ontology does not suggest that the thing does not\\nactually exist. Such a thing exists, but in a way that has it wholly\\ndependent on God. Descartes also suggests this definition of\\n“possible existence” when he contrasts necessary existence\\nwith the kind of existence had by creatures in First Replies:\\nunlike necessary existence, the existence had by a creature is marked\\nby the fact that it “has no power to create itself or maintain\\nitself in existence” (AT 7:118, CSM 2:84).

Now the reason for the existence of a\\ncontingent being cannot be within it, for if it carried the sufficient\\nreason for its own existence, it would be impossible for it not to\\nexist, which is contradictory to the definition of a contingent\\nbeing. So the sufficient reason for the existence of a contingent\\nbeing must necessarily be outside it…. This sufficient reason\\ncannot be found in another contingent being, nor in a succession of\\nsuch beings, since the same question will always arise at the end of\\nthis chain, however it may be extended. So it must come from a\\nnecessary Being that contains the sufficient reason for the existence\\nof all contingent beings, and for his own existence, and this being is\\nGod.

Just as the color orange is a real part of\\nthe color spectrum — the mathematical equation which defines the\\nlight waves of orange, on the contrary, being not a component part,\\nfor Bergson, but a “partial expression” – my own\\nduration is a real part of the duration itself. From this\\npart, I can, as Bergson would say, “dilate” or\\n“enlarge” and move into other durations. But this starting\\npoint in a part implies – and Bergson himself never seems to\\nrealize this– that intuition never gives us absolute knowledge\\nof the whole of the duration, all the component parts of the\\nduration. The whole is never given in an intuition; only a\\ncontracted part is given. Nevertheless, this experience is an integral\\none, in the sense of integrating an infinity of durations. And thus,\\neven though we cannot know all durations, every single one that comes\\ninto existence must be related, as a part, to the others. The\\nduration is that to which everything is related and in this sense it\\nis absolute.   \n",

Closed morality and\\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\\nrules of closed moralities. Kant’s moral philosophy has its\\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that\\nthere be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although\\nKant’s categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is\\nnot, according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed\\nmorality really concerns the survival of a society, my society.\\nTherefore, it always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson,\\nclosed morality is always concerned with war. And static religion, the\\nreligion of closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the\\n“fabulation function.” The fabulation function is a\\nparticular function of the imagination that creates “voluntary\\nhallucinations.” The fabulation function takes our sense that\\nthere is a presence watching over us and invents images of gods. These\\nimages then insure strict obedience to the closed morality. In short,\\nthey insure social cohesion.   \n",

Generally speaking, Buddhist\\npramāṇavāda thinkers categorize two types of\\n\\npramāṇa[16]:\\n perception\\n (pratyakṣa)[17]\\n and inference (anumāna). Objects of perception are\\ncausally efficacious particulars (svalakṣaṇa),\\nactual instance of things in the world with temporal and spatial\\nlocation. It is only particulars that are considered to be real.\\nGenerally, it would be thought that words apply to universals\\n(sāmānyalakṣaṇa) which are conceptual\\nconstructs that have no causal efficacy in the world. Thus the early\\npramāṇavāda thinkers like Dignāga and\\nDharmakīrti can be considered to hold a soft form of\\nconnotationism in that they would reject a denotationist view that\\nconsiders words to apply directly to actual particulars. The intuition\\nthat a word points to a particular would be very objectionable. A word\\ncannot express a particular because particulars are limitless and\\nwords have limits. Yet they are soft connotationists in that via a\\nprocess of elimination or exclusion, they posit a way in which\\nlanguage is both not arbitrary and not a reference to particulars.\\nInferences are cognitions based on valid reasons that depend on this\\nnon-arbitrary use of\\n language.[18]   \n",

For example, Kumārila charges that the Buddhist\\napoha theories are counter-intuitive in that our intuition is\\nnot that words and concepts refer to negations or exclusions.\\nŚāntarakṣita argues that Kumārila misunderstands\\napoha to always be non-implicative negations. He misses the\\ntwo types of implicative negations that Śāntarakṣita\\nclearly specifies as included among forms of exclusions. For\\nŚāntarakṣita, when we use words, the objects of such\\nconceptual thoughts are the real objects. They are the indirect object\\nof the exclusion that is a form of implicative negation, which\\nincludes negative aspects by implication. Thus, words can be\\nindicative of positive elements. The external object implies the image\\nplus the exclusion of that which is other. The words or concepts thus\\ntake external objects as their objects and imply the conceptual\\nexclusions. Thus when Kumārila mistakes all exclusions to be\\nnon-implicative negations, he misses this key component to the\\npsychological functions at work and mistakes apoha theory to\\nbe counter-intuitive.   \n",

Thus we may also conclude that the first mover is not a\\nbody. But there being only two kinds of substances (Cordemoy’s\\nthird axiom), bodies and minds, only a mind remains as a candidate for\\nthe first mover. Further, it is clear that our (finite) minds are not\\nthe source of motion in bodies. In the first place, our minds cannot\\neffect our bodies in certain ways, either because they are immune to\\nsuch influence (e.g., I cannot will the cells in my liver to cease\\ndividing) or because of old age or injury (e.g., a crippled man cannot\\nwill himself to walk). Second—and noteworthy in that it\\nanticipates both Malebranche and Hume—if we restrict ourselves\\nto what we observe, we never experience a causal connection but only\\ntemporal succession between our volitions at one moment and our\\nbody’s actions the next. Third, if we could produce motion in\\nbodies at will, it would, says Cordemoy, upset God’s plan for\\nthe quantity of motion which God conserves in the world.

For example, there is enough to\\nshow that I and O are subcontraries:\\nthey cannot both be false. For suppose that I is\\nfalse. Then its contradictory, E, is true. So\\nE’s contrary, A, is false. So\\nA’s contradictory, O, is true. This\\nrefutes the possibility that I and O\\nare both false, and thus fills in the bottom relation of\\nsubcontraries. Subalternation also follows. Suppose that the\\nA form is true. Then its contrary E\\nform must be false. But then the E form’s\\ncontradictory, I, must be true. Thus if the\\nA form is true, so must be the I\\nform.

Those in the first group regard\\nmembership in the species Homo sapiens as sufficient for full\\nmoral status and ground that status in a species-based attribute (See\\n Sec. 5.1).\\n For some philosophers within this first group, all homo sapiens\\nbelong to a kind whose nature or norm it is to possess rationality or\\nsimilar attributes\\n (Sec. 5.1.1).\\n For others, all homo sapiens are connected through “ties of\\nbirth” to other human beings\\n (Sec. 5.1.2).\\n For the former, any being of a kind whose nature it is to be\\nrational, etc. has full moral status; for the latter, any human\\nrelated by birth to other human beings has full moral status. Although\\nthe two approaches pick out the same individual human beings, the way\\nin which they ground moral status gives them different implications\\nfor the status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.   \n",

Both of these are based on the idea of having an\\ninfinitely large foundation. An example of this type of foundation can\\nbe constructed with the help of infinitary disjunctions, as both Rabin\\n& Rabern and Dixon demonstrate (Litland 2016b discusses the\\nproblems associated with this and constructs further examples). In\\nsuch a case, (MF) is satisfied because every element depends on some\\nindependent element, despite there being no lower bound. There is no\\nlower bound because the chain does not terminate if the foundation is\\ninfinitely large. In contrast, if the foundation is finite, then the\\nthere is a lower bound and hence the weaker requirement of (MF) is\\nalso entailed. In decreasing order of strength, we have the\\nrequirement of set-theoretical well-foundedness, having a lower bound,\\nand having a foundation or full foundations. We defined (MF) in terms\\nof the weakest of these three requirements in\\n section 2,\\n but a proponent of metaphysical foundationalism may of course make a\\nstronger requirement as well, such as having a lower bound.   \n",

We can say that an order < on a domain is\\nbounded from below if any subset of that domain has a lower bound.\\nMore precisely, a lower bound of a given set is any element that is\\nmore minimal or equal to all of the elements of the set. For example,\\n1, 2, and 3 are all lower bounds of the interval [3, 4, 5]. A lower\\nbound of a set does not need to be an element of the set itself.\\nConsequently, the chain \\(f < \\ldots d_{3} < d_{2} < d_{1}\\),\\nis bounded from below. More generally, any finite chain is\\nset-theoretically well-founded and bounded from below. We’ve\\njust seen that some infinitely descending chains of dependence may be\\nbounded from below yet fail to be set-theoretically well-founded. As\\nRabin & Rabern (2016: 360) put it, an infinitely descending chain\\nmay or may not have a “limit”, where limit is the greatest\\nlower bound of a set. In the previous example, 3 is the greatest lower\\nbound of the interval [3, 4, 5]. So, one might suggest that the\\nrelevant sense of metaphysical well-foundedness is captured either by\\nthis idea of being bounded from below or by having a limit, a greatest\\nlower bound. But it turns out that even these may be too strong. This\\nis the key insight in the recent work of Dixon and Rabin & Rabern.\\nIf this is right, then we need to have a sense of a metaphysical\\nfoundation that is not only compatible with infinite chains of\\ndependence, but also with infinite chains that do not have a lower\\nbound (i.e., “unbounded”\\n chains).[22]   \n",

The left implication rule has what are \\ncalled “shared contexts”: the assumptions and cases in \\nthe conclusion, except for the formula with the connective, are \\nrepeated identically in both premisses. Ketonen's idea was to define \\na system of proof search: one starts from a given sequent to be \\nderived, chooses a formula in it, and writes the premisses of a rule \\nthat can conclude the given sequent. By invertibility, the question \\nof derivability is replaced by one or two equivalent questions of \\nderivability on simpler sequents. The new rules are needed to ensure \\nuniquely defined premisses in such “root-first” \\ndecomposition.   \n",

Closed morality and\\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\\nrules of closed moralities. Kant’s moral philosophy has its\\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that\\nthere be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although\\nKant’s categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is\\nnot, according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed\\nmorality really concerns the survival of a society, my society.\\nTherefore, it always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson,\\nclosed morality is always concerned with war. And static religion, the\\nreligion of closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the\\n“fabulation function.” The fabulation function is a\\nparticular function of the imagination that creates “voluntary\\nhallucinations.” The fabulation function takes our sense that\\nthere is a presence watching over us and invents images of gods. These\\nimages then insure strict obedience to the closed morality. In short,\\nthey insure social cohesion.</td>\n",

As\\nDescartes argues in the Fourth Meditation, we are in no way more like\\nGod—that is, more perfect—than in our possession of free\\nwill. Hence the correct use of this will is our greatest good:\\n“free will is in itself the noblest thing we can have, since it\\nmakes us in a way equal to God and seems to exempt us from being his\\nsubjects; and so its correct use is the greatest of all the goods we\\npossess” (AT V 85/CSMK 326). Reason shows that the greatest good\\nwithin our power is the perfection of the will. In any choice we make,\\nthe value of the particular goods we pursue will always be less than\\nthat of the will itself; hence, provided we act virtuously, we can be\\ncontent, whether or not we succeed in obtaining whatever other goods\\nwe seek.</td>\n",

Three\\nlongstanding philosophical doctrines compose the theory: (1) the\\nPlatonic view that goodness is coextensive with reality or being, (2)\\nthe perfectionist view that the highest good consists in the\\ndevelopment and perfection of one's nature, and (3) the hedonist view\\nthat the highest good is pleasure. This set of doctrines is disclosed\\nin Leibniz's tripartite division of the good into the metaphysical\\ngood, the moral good, and the physical good (T §209, p. 258). He\\nequates the metaphysical good with reality, moral goodness with\\nvirtue, and the physical good with pleasure. Moreover, with each type\\nof good exists a correlative type of evil. The metaphysical good of\\nreality correlates with the metaphysical evil of privation of reality\\nor non-being. Similarly, the moral goodness of virtue relates to the\\nmoral evil of sin or vice. Finally, the physical good of pleasure is\\ncontrary to the physical evil of pain (T §21, p. 136). The theory\\nconstructed out of these divergent doctrines illustrates Leibniz's\\neclectic approach to philosophical investigation. As he puts it in a\\ncomment on his own system of philosophy, “This system appears to\\nunite Plato with Democritus, Aristotle with Descartes, the Scholastics\\nwith the moderns, theology and morality with reason. Apparently it\\ntakes the best from all systems and then advances further than anyone\\nhas yet done” (NE, p. 71).</td>\n",

This is the\\nsolution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing\\nthe teaching of the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus, Campanella says that\\nthey are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses\\nand dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a\\nlarge responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is\\nexercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of\\nsuffering. Moreover, there is a close connection between a person’s\\nnatural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not\\nafterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable\\nterrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore\\nrespect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual\\nsentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection\\nbetween men and women, based on friendship and respect more than\\nsexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from\\nsexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing.\\nSexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding\\nthe physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a\\npropitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a\\nunion is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate\\nrelationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of\\ngeneration and to love for the collective community.</td>\n",

Beauvoir describes the intentionality of\\nconsciousness as operating in two ways. First, there is the activity\\nof wanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second, there is the\\nactivity of bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of\\nactivity consciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In\\nthe second, it uses its freedom to articulate meaning and give meaning\\nto the world. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with\\na mood: the first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods\\nof hope and domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality\\nbecomes the ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends\\non whether the mood of hope or domination prevails.</td>\n",

The worry about fungibility is commonly put\\nthis way: if we accept that love can be justified by appealing to\\nproperties of the beloved, then it may seem that in loving someone for\\ncertain reasons, I love him not simply as the individual he is, but as\\ninstantiating those properties. And this may imply that any other\\nperson instantiating those same properties would do just as well: my\\nbeloved would be fungible. Indeed, it may be that another person\\nexhibits the properties that ground my love to a greater degree than\\nmy current beloved does, and so it may seem that in such a case I have\\nreason to “trade up”—to switch my love to the new,\\nbetter person. However, it seems clear that the objects of our loves\\nare not fungible: love seems to involve a deeply personal commitment\\nto a particular person, a commitment that is antithetical to the idea\\nthat our beloveds are fungible or to the idea that we ought to be\\nwilling to trade up when\\n possible.[18]</td>\n",

If denying separates the thought into its parts,\\nthen double negation would function as a sword that magically unites\\nthe parts it had sundered (Frege 1918 [1952: 122–129]).

While he does claim that the only proper justification\\nof punishment is guilt for a crime, he does not limit the usefulness\\nof punishment to retributivist matters. Punishment can have as its\\njustification only the guilt of the criminal. All other uses of\\npunishment, such as rehabilitation (the alleged good of the criminal)\\nor deterrence (alleged good to society) uses the criminal merely as a\\nmeans (6:331). Once this guilt is determined, however, Kant does not\\ndeny that something useful can be drawn from the punishment. In the\\nFeyerabend lectures on Natural Right, Kant is clear that the sovereign\\n“must punish in order to obtain security”, and even while\\nusing the law of retribution, “in such a way the best security\\nis obtained” (27:1390–91). The state is authorized to use\\nits coercive force to defend freedom against limitations to freedom;\\nmore particularly, since right does not entail that citizens must\\nlimit their own freedom but only that “freedom is limited”\\nby conditions of right, it is right for another, i.e. the state, to\\nactively limit citizens’ freedom in accord with right (6:231).\\nThe state is authorized to use force to defend property rights\\n(6:256). Kant’s view, then, is that punishment of a particular\\nindividual may serve deterrent functions even when the punishment may\\nnot be based solely on deterrence as its justification.</td>\n",

The compliance problem—the problem of justifying\\nrational compliance with the norms that have been accepted—must\\ndrive the justification of the initial situation and the conduct of\\nthe contracting situation. It is helpful to think of the contract\\nsituation as a bargain, in which each party is trying to negotiate the\\nmoral rules that will allow them to realize optimal utility, and this\\nhas led philosophers to apply a number of bargaining solutions to the\\ninitial contract situation. Gauthier’s solution is the “minimax\\nrelative concession” (1986, ch. V). The idea of minimax relative\\nconcession is that each bargainer will be most concerned with the\\nconcessions that she makes from her ideal outcome relative to the\\nconcessions that others make. If she sees her concessions as\\nreasonable relative to the others, considering that she wants to\\nensure as much for herself as she can while securing agreement (and\\nthereby avoiding the zero-point: no share of the cooperative surplus)\\nand subsequent compliance from the others, then she will agree to it.\\nWhat would then be the reasonable outcome? The reasonable outcome,\\naccording to this view, is the outcome that minimizes the maximum\\nrelative concessions of each party to the bargain (Gauthier 1986, ch.\\nV).</td>\n",

In the fourth Book of his\\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\\n(epithumêtikon). This terminology was also used by\\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\\nand concupiscibilis. Plato’s view of emotions was\\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\\naction-initiating impulses. Plato’s main reason for this\\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression.</td>\n",

The specific question what is a just\\nrelation in such situations (The Just, 2000; Reflections\\non the Just, 2007), developed out of Ricoeur’s\\nparticipation in a seminar for judges, and led to his reflections in\\nthe last work published during his lifetime on the idea of mutual\\nrecognition (The Course of Recognition, 2005). In those final\\nyears, he also continued to explore other dimensions of the fullness\\nof language, for example, through some significant essays on the\\nnotion of translation as occurring not just between languages but also\\nwithin them (On Translation, 2006).</td>\n",

After the completion of his graduate study in physics,\\nSchlick soon turned his attention to philosophy (Schlick 2006a). \\nWithin a few short years he had written a youthfully enthusiastic\\nethical tract in 1908, called Lebensweisheit, a lucid analysis\\nof concept-formation called “The Boundaries of Scientific and\\nPhilosophical Concept-Formation” (1910), as well as a substantial\\nessay on “The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” (1910)\\n(Schlick 2006b; Schlick 1979a, 25–40, 41–103). In “The\\nBoundaries…”, Schlick provided a broad sketch of his\\nunderstanding of scientific thought, which identifies the aim of\\nscience as the reduction of phenomena to relationships governed by law,\\nthus exhibiting individual events as special cases of universal,\\nexceptionless regularities. Science is expressed mathematically, in\\nspatio-temporal form to provide for exact measurement. And the\\nindividual sciences are demarcated by distinctive intensive qualities,\\nas ‘mass’ distinguishes mechanics, ‘heat’\\nthermodynamics, etc. Although the methods of mathematico-scientific\\nconcept-formation reduces the entire natural world to purely\\nquantitative relations, it is powerless in the face of irreducible pure\\nqualities. This is the task of philosophy so that philosophy\\nbecomes the theory of qualities. Schlick’s work on\\n“The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” not only provides a\\nbroad survey of treatments of truth then current in German philosophy,\\nbut it also introduces an original view of truth as univocal\\ndesignation. A judgment, as a structured complex of its\\nconstituents, is coordinated with the fact which consists of the\\nentities signified by the judgment’s constituents, arranged in a\\nway which is coordinated with the structure of the particular\\njudgment. When the constituents are structured in a judgment so\\nthat the whole judgment univocally designates a situation in the world,\\nthen the judgment is true; otherwise, it is false. The conception\\nof truth as univocal coordination figured prominently in\\nSchlick’s pre-Positivist theory of knowledge.</td>\n",

A phenomenological description that extracts the\\n“essential features” from the phenomenon of cognition\\nwould note that: cognizers face off against something to-be-cognized;\\nthey attempt to “grasp” that something; they form an\\n“image” (broadly speaking) of that something; the image is\\nsomehow “determined” by the something; that something is\\nentirely untouched by the cognizer’s attempt to grasp it; they\\nmay or may not be in error about it (truth criterion); cognizers may\\nbecome conscious of problems surrounding the something; and they may\\nsucceed or fail in making cognitive progress regarding them (ME5a-i).\\nFrom among these factors, take the central feature of\\n“grasping.” The phenomenon of grasping generates an\\naporia: how does the mind go “out of itself” to grasp a\\ntranscendent object? The sense of being faced with something that one\\ndid not anticipate or create and that one must now “grasp”\\nis often simply backgrounded by antirealists who claim that the mind\\nunconsciously creates its objects, or is imprisoned in a circle of its\\nown “positings” (ME6a). This is a\\n“skeptical-subjectivistic” resolution to the aporia of\\ngrasping that simply ignores rather than does justice to the\\nphenomenon. It fails to distinguish between image and thing; what is\\ncurrently “objectified” in it; the object and the\\n“transobjective” (currently unknown but knowable); and\\nwhat may even be “transintelligible” (nonrational) in the\\nthing. Only by retaining the Kantian distinction between object\\n(appearance) and “thing-in-itself” can we account for this\\ncentral phenomenon of grasping. Far from being irrelevant, Hartmann\\nbelieves that the thing-in-itself is the “fundamental and\\neminently critical concept” (ME30a). It is needed to explain the\\nphenomenon of transcendence in the total phenomenon of cognition.\\nProblem consciousness, which entails “knowing that you\\ndon’t know,” implicitly recognizes what is transobjective,\\nand possibly transintelligible, in the thing. It implies a relation\\nbetween the subject as existing knower and something existing\\nindependently of it. The phenomenon of cognition overflows the domain\\nof epistemology into ontology.</td>\n",

That is the aim of what is perhaps the most prominent\\nstrategy employed in recent theodicy, which is based on the concept of\\nfree will, and its importance in the plan of creation. The free will\\ndefense begins by distinguishing two kinds of evil. Moral\\nevil is evil that occurs through rational action — that is,\\nthrough wrongful exercises of will on the part of rational beings.\\nNatural evil, by contrast, is owing entirely to the operation\\nof natural causes. To see how this distinction works, we need to\\nrealize that moral evil can itself be divided into several categories.\\nFirst come exercises of will that are sinful in themselves, and these\\nare of two kinds. They include wrongful acts of intention formation,\\nas when one maliciously decides to kill another, and the volitional\\nactivity through which we execute wrong intentions — e.g., the\\neffort of will aimed at carrying out the intention to murder. The\\nmoral wrong of these exercises of will is intrinsic to them.\\nThey are sinful in themselves, and would be so even if, through some\\nfortuitous circumstance, the attempt to kill went awry, and the\\nintended victim was not harmed at all. Suppose, however, that the\\naction succeeds, as it does in most instances of wrongful willing. If\\nso, further evil will occur — in the present case, the death of\\nthe victim. Now if the victim had died entirely as a result of natural\\ncauses, his death would have counted as a natural evil. In this case,\\nhowever, it counts as a kind of moral evil, for while its occurrence\\nrequires the cooperation of natural causes, those causes are set in\\nmotion by the killer’s volitional activity. Harm and suffering\\nthat are caused by wrongful willing count as extrinsic moral\\nevil, in that they are caused by acts of will that are morally evil in\\nthemselves, or intrinsically.</td>\n",

One of the more striking features of the text is its\\npredominantly philosophical flavor and its comparative lack of\\ntheological material. The principal question is devoted to the general\\nproblem of the eternity of the world. FitzRalph begins by putting\\nforward arguments against the beginning of the world in time. One goes\\nas follows: if God’s power is always the same, then it was the\\nsame before the world was created; therefore, God could always from\\neternity have produced the world. Thus, there is no contradiction in\\nstating that the world has always existed. FitzRalph attributes this\\nposition to the Commentary on the Sentences of Thomas Aquinas.\\nIndeed, he continues that, even if the world is not from eternity, we\\ncan argue that in the future God might make it so, since what he once\\ncan do, he can always do. In other words, it remains part of\\nGod’s power to make a universe that has always existed, just as\\nit remains possible for God to destroy this universe, or again, to\\ncreate other universes that have always existed.</td>\n",

If we say that words signify not only concepts but\\nthings external to and independent of the mind do we mean that\\n‘human being’ and ‘tall’ signify special\\ncommon objects such as humanity or tallness, or do we mean that they\\nsignify Socrates and his quality of being tall? For Aquinas, who did\\nnot want to give common natures any kind of intermediary existence\\nindependent of both concepts and actual things, the significate\\n(significatum) of a term was the intellect’s conception\\n(whether simple or definitional) of the thing signified; the thing\\nsignified (res significata) was usually the property or the\\nnature characterizing individual external objects; and the referent\\n(suppositum) was the individual external object itself,\\nviewed as the bearer of the property or nature. However,‘human\\nbeing’ cannot be said to  signify  Socrates, since the\\nmind cannot conceive physical individuals as such. In the fourteenth\\ncentury, further developments took place. There was a new focus on the\\nnotion of a mental language superior to spoken language, and concepts,\\nas parts of this mental language, were themselves regarded as having\\nsignification. Moreover, Scotists and nominalists agreed that, at\\nleast in principle, physical individuals could be conceived as such.\\nWilliam of Ockham and his followers not only denied the existence of\\ncommon natures but insisted that spoken words did not signify\\nconcepts. As a result, both spoken words and the concepts to which\\nspoken words are subordinated have the same significates, namely\\nindividual things and their individual properties, such as the\\ntallness of Socrates. Other nominalists, notably Buridan, insisted\\nthat spoken words did signify concepts as well as individuals, for\\nconcepts are required to mediate between spoken words and individual\\nthings.</td>\n",

Because there are wrongless harms\\n(think of sporting injures caused without foul play) and harmless\\nwrongs (think of botched conspiracies or undiscovered attempts) the\\naforementioned values do not always wax and wane together. One\\npossibility is that criminal law’s concern with wrongs is\\nderivative of its concern with harms: criminal law should prevent\\nwrongs (e.g., conspiracy to injure) when and because harm is thereby\\nprevented (e.g., injury itself). Another possibility is that criminal\\nlaw’s concern with harms is derivative of its concern with\\nwrongs: criminal law should prevent harms (e.g., physical injury) when\\nand because those harms are wrongfully caused (e.g., by assault)\\n(Feinberg 1987, 151–155; Moore 1997, 647–649). A third\\npossibility is that harms and wrongs provide two independent sources\\nof general justification (compare Tadros 2016,\\n162–166).

In fact, Abelard argues, it can even be just to\\npunish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. He cites\\ntwo cases. First, a woman accidentally smothers her baby while trying\\nto keep it warm at night, and is overcome with grief. Abelard\\nmaintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her\\npunishment may have on others: it may make other poor mothers more\\ncareful not to accidentally smother their babies while trying to keep\\nthem warm. Second, a judge may have excellent (but legally\\nimpermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself; since he\\ncannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on\\nthe basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he\\nbelieves to be innocent, is guilty. Human justice may with propriety\\nignore questions of intention. Since there is divine justice, ethical\\nnotions are not an idle wheel—nor should they be, even on\\nAbelard’s understanding of human justice, since they are the\\nmeans by which we determine which intentions to promote or discourage\\nwhen we punish people as examples or in order to deter others.</td>\n",

Eventually a subject is reached that cannot itself be\\npredicated of anything else, recalling Aristotle’s\\nhypokeimenon or individual substance that can be subject but\\nnever predicate. Even when modern epistemology eschewed or at least\\nmodified Aristotle’s notion of substance as a substrate for contingent\\nproperties, it appealed to substrates in the sense that they define\\nthe primary subject of a judgment, that is, the judgment’s topic and grammatical subject.  Similar to phenomenologists,\\nNishida wanted to account for the consciousness that posits such\\nsubstances and underlies the subject of a judgment. Essays in From\\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and subsequent works\\ninvert Aristotle’s notion of the hypokeimenon and propose that\\nconsciousness is the “transcendental predicate” that can\\nnever be a subject; in other words consciousness in act can never be\\nmade an object of consciousness that could become a grammatical subject.  Nishida is aware of the paradox of\\nsuch formulations that would make consciousness the subject of\\nsentences that describe it, and he sometimes resorts to explicitly\\nparadoxical descriptions such as “seeing without a seer”\\nand “seeing the form of the formless, hearing the voice of the\\nvoiceless.” But he again also uses the straightforward metaphor,\\nthe “field of consciousness,” to indicate its\\nnon-subjective and non-objectifiable character. Consciousness cannot\\nbe grasped as the property of an individual substance nor as anything\\nlike a substance or underlying substrate itself. It functions as the\\nfield that is the opening of world and self.</td>\n",

The concept\\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.</td>\n",

In Whitehead’s view, God customizes the general\\npotentiality of the universe for each emergent occasion, providing it\\nwith its initial aim. The graded relevance of these potentialities\\nanswers to our sense that there are objectively better and worse\\noptions. A related problem is how the activities of the many\\nactualities that make up the cosmos happen to obey a common set of\\nnatural laws. Order implies an ordering power; however, all localized\\norder presupposes cosmic order; thus, order on a cosmic scale requires\\na cosmic ordering power. The best candidate for the cosmic ordering\\npower is God, according to Whitehead (Whitehead 1926 [1997, 104])—this\\nis a type of design argument. Another consideration is that the realm\\nof possibility in terms of which cosmic order is conceived is akin to\\nPlato’s Forms. In Whitehead’s system, these “eternal\\nobjects” require an ontological ground. The primordial nature of\\nGod serves this function (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 46]). Finally, the consequent\\nnature of God is the explanation of the fixity of accomplished fact\\nand achieved value. “The truth itself is nothing else than how\\nthe composite natures of the organic actualities of the world obtain\\nadequate representation in the divine nature” (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\\n12]). This sketch of Whitehead’s reasoning may suggest that his\\n“arguments” lose their force when abstracted from his\\nmetaphysics. Bowman L. Clarke, however, produced a formal theistic\\nargument along Whiteheadian lines using the linguistic framework\\ndeveloped by Nelson Goodman (Clarke 1966, 162–164). In a\\ndifferent vein, Franklin Gamwell argues that the moral law must be\\ngrounded in the divine good, where the divine good is most\\nparsimoniously conceived in neoclassical terms (Gamwell 1990). Another\\nprocess thinker, Derek Malone-France, argues that the promise of\\nKant’s transcendental philosophy is best fulfilled in a\\nWhiteheadian inspired theistic metaphysics (Malone-France 2007). Thus,\\narguing for the existence of Whitehead’s God, or something like\\nWhitehead’s God, need not be inextricably tied to evaluating\\nWhitehead’s metaphysics.</td>\n",

Unlike\\nclassical Christian theism which prioritizes transcendence by deriving\\ndivine immanence from divine transcendence, panentheism balances\\ndivine transcendence and immanence (Clayton 2020). In the classical\\nChristian understanding, divine transcendence is based on the\\nontological difference in substance between God and the world making\\ninteraction between the two distinct substances impossible (Schaab\\n2006, 547, 548). The panentheistic mutual relation also differs from\\npantheism which prioritizes divine immanence by identifying the\\ninfinite with the finite. The nature of this mutual relationship\\nbasically depends upon the understanding of the ontology of each\\nmember of the relationship. The issue is the nature of being for God\\nand for the world as the basis for mutual influence between God and\\nthe world. A variety of attempts have sought to describe the nature of\\nGod’s being and the world’s being in their relationship.\\nThomistic thought utilizes a concept of analogy as it wrestles with\\nthe nature of the being of God and the being of the world (Malloy\\n2014). Others in considering God’s action in the world posit the\\nnecessity of ontological difference between God and finite reality (M.\\nLeidenhag 2014, 219). Process thought directly addresses the issue of\\nontology by calling for an ontology that does not consider substance\\nas the basic type of existence because substance does not allow for\\ninternal relations (Bracken 2014, 10). According to Wesley Wildman the\\nrelations between entities are ontologically more fundamental than the\\nentities themselves for relational ontology in contrast to\\nsubstantivist ontology where entities are ontologically primary and\\nrelations derivative (2010, 55).</td>\n",

These ideas developed as expressions of\\ntheism. Proclus (412–485 CE) and Pseudo-Dionysus (late Fifth to\\nearly Sixth century) drawing upon Plotinus developed perspectives in\\nwhich the world came from God and understood the relationship between\\nGod and the world as a dialectical relationship in which the world\\ncame from God and returned to God (J. Cooper 2006, 42–46). In\\nthe Middle Ages, the influence of Neoplatonism continued in the\\nthought of Eriugena (815–877 CE), Eckhart (1260–1328 CE),\\nNicholas of Cusa (1401–1464 CE), and Boehme (1575–1624\\nCE). Although accused of pantheism by their contemporaries, their\\nsystems can be identified as panentheistic because they understood God\\nin various ways as including the world rather than being the world and\\nbecause they used a dialectical method. The dialectical method\\ninvolved the generation of opposites and then the reconciliation of\\nthe opposition in God. This retained the distinct identity of God in\\nGod’s influence of the world (J. Cooper 2006, 47–62).\\nDuring the early modern period, Bruno (1548–1600 CE) and Spinoza\\n(1631–1677 CE) responded to the dualism of classical theism by\\nemphasizing the relationship between God and the world to the point\\nthat the nature of any ontological distinction between God and the\\nworld became problematic. Later thinkers such as the Cambridge\\nPlatonists (Seventeenth century), Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758\\nCE) (Crisp 2009), and Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834 CE)\\nthought of the world as in some way in God or a development from God.\\nAlthough they did not stress the ontological distinction between God\\nand the world, they did emphasize the responsive relationship that\\nhumans have to God. Human responsiveness assumed some degree of human\\ninitiative if not freedom, which indicates some distinction between\\nGod and humans. The assumption of some degree of human initiative was\\na reaction against the loss of freedom due to Spinoza’s close\\nidentification between God and the world (J. Cooper 2006,\\n64–90).</td>\n",

Already with Kant, it is asked whether we have\\nbesides analytic judgments also synthetic ones a priori, and\\nwhether the latter are perhaps, like the former, everywhere necessary\\nfor scientific progress. In contrast to leaving them empty and void\\nupon leaving the phenomenal sphere, however, it is clear that only\\npsychological investigation can decide this matter. It is a question\\nwhose answer is a prerequisite for every ontological and cosmological\\ninvestigation. Psychological experience and analysis is accordingly\\nalso that which leads to the source and the true sense of the most\\nimportant metaphysical concepts such as those of causality and of\\nsubstance. And as regards that problem which occupied Aristotle,\\nDescartes, and Leibniz so intensely, the question whether an analogue\\nof the understanding and the tactical will forms the last hidden cause\\nof all being and occurrence, it is obvious that this could not arise\\non any other basis but a psychological one. The concepts of the\\nunderstanding and the will are themselves taken from the domain of\\nmind.

For the question how the intellect knows the universe of\\nbeings is like the question how the eye can see colors. If the eye\\nwere any one particular color, then it would see only that\\ncolor. Aristotle, who raises this question, replies that the eye must\\nbe colorless so it can see every color. Likewise for the mind or\\nintellect. Thus it is wrong to say that the intellect is the likeness\\nof the universe of beings by its very act of knowing the universe of\\nbeings because the very reverse is true. The intellect is no one of\\nthe beings it knows.  It is truly the universe of beings, but in the\\nconceptional order. Thus it can be like the universe of beings in the\\nso-called real order.

Nevertheless, the concept of scientia plays an\\nimportant role as he develops his conception of the probabilistic sort\\nof knowledge that is possible for humans in the domain of natural\\nphilosophy: he uses it as a foil when explaining why humans must\\nsettle for probabilistic knowledge there, scientia remaining\\nalways out of reach.

The natural world is a constant reminder that God’s\\n“threefold and undivided life” flows into each single\\nthing, down to the smallest beings (ad minima usque) (De\\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). However, for all the layers and\\nmediations that characterize Cardano’s universe, the distance\\nbetween human beings and God remains unbridgeable. Man cannot reconcile\\nthe finite with the infinite, for “no finite thing can be\\ntransformed into an infinite nature.” Cardano rules out that\\n“this life of ours can get close to that which truly is,”\\nfor there is no proportion and no resemblance between the two levels of\\nbeing. Echoing Cusanian motifs, he argues that “everything that\\nis understood by a finite being is finite, for the act of understanding\\n(comprehensio) occurs through some proportion; but there is no\\nproportion between the infinite and the finite.” Likewise, our\\neyes cannot grasp the direct light (lux) of the sun, but only\\na glimpse of its brightness (lumen) (De arcanis\\naeternitatis, OO, X, 4b–5a). Such a powerful and all-encompassing\\nview of divine and natural order, in which the presence of latent\\nPlatonic and Averroist motifs contributes to strengthen the cogent\\norganization of the whole universe, has inevitable repercussions\\nconcerning the meaning of moral action. During his life, Cardano\\ndevoted a considerable number of works to ethical inquiries, surveying\\nalmost every aspect in the field: theoretical ethics, applied ethics,\\nprudential behaviour, consolation, education, and the role of rhetoric.\\nHowever, his most important contribution to moral philosophy consists\\nin his attempt to redefine the relationship between the universal scope\\nof practical reason and the need for human beings to apply moral laws\\nto the concrete circumstances of their life. This characteristic\\ntension between knowledge and application is particularly evident in\\ntwo works: Theonoston (which Cardano began to write around\\n1555) and De utilitate ex adversis capienda (published in\\n1561).</td>\n",

The object of the life of enjoyment\\nis bodily pleasure; that of political activity is honor or even\\nvirtue. The object of the life of study is philosophical or scientific\\nunderstanding. Arguing that the end of human life must be the most\\ncomplete, he concludes that happiness is the most complete end.\\nWhereas pleasure, honor, virtue, and understanding are choice-worthy\\nin themselves, they are also chosen for the sake of happiness.\\nHappiness is not chosen for the sake of anything else\\n(1097a25–1097b5).

However, it is more likely that the other choice-worthy ends\\nare constituents of happiness. As a consequence, the happy life is\\ncomposed of such activities as virtuous pursuits, honorable acts, and\\ncontemplation of truth. While conceiving these choice-worthy ends as\\nconstituents of happiness might be illuminating, it does, in turn,\\nraise the issue of whether happiness is a jumble of activities or\\nwhether it requires organization – even prioritization –\\nof the constituents.</td>\n",

Jevons refutes the claims of some “sentimental\\nwriters” who regard economics as a “dismal science”,\\nbecause its scope is restricted to wealth. These authors depict\\neconomics as a mechanical and miserable body of theories, whereas they\\nhold true that a moral science should be concerned with sympathies,\\nfeelings and duties. Jevons uses an analogy from the natural\\nsciences to refute this opinion: division of labour implies that some\\npeople investigate the mechanical aspects of iron, while other\\nresearchers devote their time to the study of its electrical or\\nmagnetic aspects. A physician may conclude that the health of a\\nparticular person will be fostered if he goes to the sea, but this\\nperson may decide otherwise by taking other considerations into\\naccount.

Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of\\nself-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she\\nsought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For\\nexample, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or\\ncame in late for work because “all human interest has been\\nextracted from it” (SYC 129). Although Addams valued\\nRuskin’s moral imagination, the concept of labor, and ideas\\nabout transforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his\\nromanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in\\nsocial progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For\\nAddams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions, even\\nregarding moral philosophy.</td>\n",

It seems to depend on\\na particular way of thinking about the world and what is beyond the\\nworld. Both world and agent need to be thought of in terms of effect\\nand receptivity to effect; and then the Beyond needs to be conceived\\nin analogy and contrast with this aspect of the world, in its relation\\nto the agent (subject of the feeling). A person who did not engage in\\nthis process of thought, at least covertly or subconsciously, would\\nnever get to the feeling of absolute dependence as Schleiermacher\\ndescribes it. 2) Schleiermacher is a Christian theologian and thinks\\nhe has given an account of the most basic experience of God. But any\\nGod who existed would be part of the “world” on\\nSchleiermacher’s conception and thus could not be the object of the\\nfeeling of absolute dependence. Furthermore, the God of Christian\\ntradition is not utterly incapable of being affected by human beings.\\nGod responds to states of the world with actions and emotions, and\\nhears and answers prayer. 3) Absolutizing the dependency relationship\\nin the way that Schleiermacher does seems to evacuate\\n‘dependency’ of its usual meaning. The “other”\\ntowards which one feels absolutely “dependent” in\\nSchleiermacher’s conception must be predicateless to protect it\\nagainst any influence (in particular, epistemic contact) from the side\\nof the world; but that move eliminates any positive sense in which we\\ndepend on it. Absolute dependence in the object comes to equal\\nabsolute incapability of being affected, and the feeling of absolute\\ndependence amounts to a feeling of complete lack of effective agency\\nvis-à-vis the other — that is, it becomes a\\npurely negative conception. So the feeling of absolute dependence\\nmight better be called the feeling of absolute impotence.</td>\n",

As in Pauline doctrine, the\\nhabitus of the will, which is love (caritas), is\\npreferable to the habitus of the intellect, which is\\nknowledge. Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\\nGod. The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\\n“primacy of essence” should be attributed to\\nvoluntas, whereas “primacy of action” should be\\nattributed to ratio.</td>\n",

The inner\\ntestimony of one’s own cogito attests to the existence of\\nsomething contingent. Since the sufficient reason for the existence of\\ncontingent things must “indirectly” be a necessary being,\\na necessary being exists.

In process\\nmetaphysics no actual entity is wholly determined by the activity of\\nanother; or phrased positively, every actual entity retains\\nsome power of self-determination, however minimal or slight\\nit may be. According to this view, to have power in relation to others\\nis to have power in relation to other entities with some degree of\\npower. This is process philosophy’s doctrine of universal\\ncreativity. Hartshorne says, “To be is to create”\\n(Hartshorne 1970, 1, 272). The logic of the matter does not change if\\nGod is included in the metaphysical scheme. For process theism, God is\\nthe supreme or eminent creative power, but not the only creative\\npower. Thus, process theists speak of God and the creatures as\\nco-creators (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000, 140]; Hartshorne 1967a,\\n113).</td>\n",

The Logic\\ncondenses this framework so that the significance of general ideas has\\ntwo aspects: the comprehension and the extension.\\nThe comprehension consists in the set of attributes essential to the\\nidea. For example, the comprehension of the idea\\n“triangle” includes the attributes extension, shape, three\\nlines, three angles, etc. The extension of the idea consists in the\\nparticular objects to which it applies, which includes “all the\\ndifferent species of triangles” (I.6, 39–40). Here the\\nauthors confuse matters by trying to incorporate the traditional terms\\n“inferiors” and “species”, taking the latter\\nfor individual objects. Usually, however, they straightforwardly take\\nthe extension of a general idea to be the individuals possessing the\\nattributes in its comprehension. There are three key features of this\\ntheory of signification. First, the comprehension rather than the\\nextension is essential to the function of a general idea: one cannot\\nremove an attribute without destroying it—making it into a\\ndifferent idea, whereas one can restrict its extension by applying it\\nto only some of the objects that fall under it. Second, the\\ncomprehension governs the extension: the set of attributes determines\\nthe individuals in its extension. Finally, comprehensions and\\nextensions are inversely related. In adding attributes to the\\ncomprehension of an idea one restricts its extension. For example, the\\ncomprehension of the idea “mammal” includes that of the\\nidea “animal” so the extension of “animal”\\nincludes that of “mammal.” The Logic implicitly\\nassumes this principle throughout the text. In recognizing these two\\nmodes of the signification of words—both the comprehension of\\nthe associated idea and the objects in the extension—it replaces\\nthe traditional distinction between incomplete and complete entities\\nin the treatment of the signification of general terms.</td>\n",

In the last\\ncompleted essay, “The Logic of Place and the Religious\\nWorldview” (1945), Nishida is more experiential. Death is not an\\nevent at the end of one’s life but penetrates life at each and every\\nmoment. It is the ever-present opening, so to speak, where one’s utter\\nfinitude can come to light. Insofar as this is the finitude of the\\nindividual self, it also implies a logic of individuation where the\\nrole of other relative selves is diminished. “I am myself by\\nknowing my own death” (NKZ XI, 420) is both a declaration of\\nexistential self-awareness and a statement of what makes me uniquely\\nme. What makes me an individual is not merely my differences from\\nothers nor my sameness with some essential core; it is precisely what\\nmost makes me not me, what negates me, in any moment\\nof action.

These “two styles” do not correspond to the “two phases” in the earlier definition of deconstruction. On the one hand, there is the genealogical style of deconstruction, which recalls the history of a concept or theme. Earlier in his career, in Of Grammatology, Derrida had laid out, for example, the history of the concept of writing. But now what is at issue is the history of justice. On the other hand, there is the more formalistic or structural style of deconstruction, which examines a-historical paradoxes or aporias. In “Force of Law,” Derrida lays out three aporias, although they all seem to be variants of one, an aporia concerning the unstable relation between law (the French term is “droit,” which also means “right”) and justice.</td>\n",

This leaves unanswered\\nhow non-sympathetic compassion is possible. Aquinas provides a less\\nobviously question begging reply. He says that to love another is to\\nwill the good of the other; God necessarily wills the good of the\\nother, so God is love (Summa Theologica I, Q 20, a. 2).\\nProcess theists do not deny that love requires willing the good of the\\nother, but they maintain that it requires something more, or at very\\nleast that there are greater forms of love of which willing the good\\nof the other is a necessary aspect. Divine love is more than\\nbeneficence; it includes sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the\\nbeloved. This idea is expressed in Whitehead’s depiction of God\\nas “the great companion—the fellow-sufferer who\\nunderstands” (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 351]). Hartshorne points out that\\nAnselm’s God can give us “everything except the right to\\nbelieve that there is one who, with infinitely subtle and appropriate\\nsensitivity, rejoices in all our joys and sorrows in all our\\nsorrows” (Hartshorne 1948, 54).</td>\n",

Because evil\\nposes the most difficult problems for traditional views of divine\\nprovidence, this discussion will be organized around the theme of\\nevil. In its classical formulation, the problem of evil is a problem\\nof logical consistency. The opponent of theism alleges that a triad of\\nproperties traditionally held to belong to God’s nature —\\nomniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence — are not jointly\\nconsistent with the existence of evil in the world. An omniscient God,\\nwe must assume, would have knowledge of the evil in the world. An\\nomnibenevolent God would desire to halt or prevent it, and an\\nomnipotent God should be able to do so. Yet evil is rife. It must be,\\nthen, that God lacks at least one of the triad of attributes, and\\nperhaps all of them. Perhaps as creator he is somewhat in the dark as\\nto what evils may occur, and once they appear it is too late to\\nforestall them. On the other hand, it may be that evil is endemic\\n— built into the structure of any world, so that even God is\\npowerless to prevent it. Or, maybe he just doesn’t care, and has\\nlong since turned his attention to projects more interesting than\\nnurturing our feeble destinies. Whatever the reason, the argument\\nruns, he is not the God of Abraham, of Jesus, and of Mohammed. Their\\nGod simply would not permit wanton wrongdoing, nor would he allow the\\nsuffering and duress under which all creation labors. So while the\\npresence of evil in the world does not serve to prove there is no God\\nat all, it does show there is no God of the kind adumbrated in\\nreligious tradition.</td>\n",

If every fact about Julius Caesar, and indeed,\\nevery other fact about the universe is rationally deducible from the\\nRoman Dictator’s complete concept, then it would seem that only\\none course for the universe is possible. However, this is not a step\\nthat Leibniz was willing to take. Were there no distinction between\\ncontingent and necessary truths, argued Leibniz, fatalism would be\\ntrue, and human liberty of the will would be impossible. Leibniz\\nsought to avert this result by distinguishing between hypothetical and\\nabsolute necessity. Absolute necessity, he argued, is governed by the\\nprinciple of contradiction. Something is absolutely necessary if its\\nnegation is logically impossible. Hypothetical necessity, on the other\\nhand, describes a state of affairs that is necessary ex\\nhypothesi—that is, just in case a particular antecedent\\nholds—but not logically necessary. On Leibniz’s account,\\nthe fact that Caesar crossed the Rubicon is only hypothetically\\nnecessary; it follows necessarily from the existence of the individual\\nsubstance that is Caesar, but its denial is not logically\\nimpossible. According to Leibniz, God at creation conceived of an\\ninfinite array of possible worlds. The myriad contingent facts of each\\nof these worlds are only hypothetically necessary. That is, they would\\nonly be necessary if God were to instantiate that world. Since the\\npresent world is the one that God chose to instantiate, all of the\\ncontingent facts of this world are certain. However, they are\\nnonetheless contingent since their negation implies no absurdity. That\\nis, there was no logical impossibility preventing Caesar from deciding\\nnot to cross the Rubicon. In this sense, his will—and, indeed,\\nhuman will generally—is free.  Leibniz’s argument for\\nhypothetical necessity has an obvious antecedent in Descartes’s\\ndoctrine of created truth. However, unlike Descartes, Leibniz limited\\nthe doctrine’s scope to contingent truths. He nonetheless hoped\\nto avoid Spinozist necessitarianism. Whether or not he succeeded in\\ndoing so is a matter of debate in the literature.</td>\n",

In other words, through what does knowledge receive its\\nobjectivity?” (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his\\nmajor work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge?\\nIn asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a\\ntranscendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that\\n(1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true\\nthought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some\\nthought-independent object, how are we to think this\\nthought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert\\nrejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to\\nskepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that\\nskepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be\\nmeaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely\\nwhat knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version\\nof skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl’s\\nepoché (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory\\nof knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some\\npresuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a\\nsubject successfully grasps an object. “However, the theory of\\nknowledge ought to be ‘presuppositionless’ in the sense\\nthat it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon\\nwhich the objectivity of knowledge rests” (Rickert 1921a, 12).\\nIt is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key\\nquestion as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent\\nreality existing independently of consciousness as the source\\nof validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge,\\nthen, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its\\nrelation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning\\none of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely,\\nthat there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion\\nthat validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this\\nsubject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent\\nreality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and\\npresumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be\\nprecisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully\\nconceived of as a reality and that only values can be\\nconsidered genuinely transcendent.</td>\n",

It is the inherent\\nincompleteness of all finite determinations which reveals the nature\\nof the absolute. His description of time makes clear what he means:\\n“time is itself nothing but the totality appearing in\\nopposition to the particular life of things”, so that the\\ntotality “posits or intuits itself, by not positing, not\\nintuiting the particular” (SW I/6, p. 220). The particular is\\ndetermined in judgements, but the truth of claims about the totality\\ncannot be proven because judgements are necessarily conditioned,\\nwhereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the\\nparticular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be\\naware of that relativity, and this ground must have a\\ndifferent status from the knowable world of finite particulars. At the\\nsame time, if the ground were wholly different from the world of\\nrelative particulars the problems of dualism would recur. As such the\\nabsolute is the finite, but we do not know this in\\nthe manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of\\n‘absolute identity’, therefore, the evident relativity of\\nparticular knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no\\nreason to claim that a revised judgement is predicated of the same\\nworld as the preceding — now false — judgement.</td>\n",

According to one \\napproach—typified by Ptolemy in pre-modern thought and sometimes\\nassociated with “save the phenomena” type \\nexplanations—hypotheses are posited merely because they are useful\\ninstruments, mere mathematical calculating devices especially useful\\nfor prediction and scientific practice. The aim with hypotheses,\\naccording to this approach, is not to propose a true account\\nof the nature of things since reaching true conclusions about the world\\nis not necessarily relevant when formulating hypotheses according to\\nthis tradition which focuses more pointedly on prediction. According to\\nthe second approach—typified by Aristotle in pre-modern thought\\nand sometimes associated with causal explanations—hypotheses\\nare posited in order to provide an explanation of how experienced\\neffects might have come about. The aim is to give a true\\naccount of the nature of things, especially the causal nature\\nof\\n things.[22]\\nIn starting off her chapter\\non hypotheses with a mention of “the true causes of natural\\neffects”, Du Châtelet indicates her commitment to the\\nAristotelian tradition vis à viz hypotheses, a point\\nwhich becomes abundantly clear as her chapter on hypotheses\\nproceeds.</td>\n",

The concept\\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.</td>\n",

But how are the two\\nnatures related? Are they identical or distinct? For Gelug argues that\\nthere are only two possibilities: either the two natures are identical\\n(ngo bo gcig) or distinct (ngo bo tha dad); there\\ncannot be a third (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176). They are related in terms of\\nbeing a single entity with distinct conceptual identities—thus\\nthey are both the same and different. Since the two natures are the\\nbasis of the relationship between the two truths, the relationship\\nbetween the two truths will reflect the relationship between the two\\nnatures. Just as the two natures are of a same entity, ultimate truth\\nand conventional truth are of same ontological status.</td>\n",

But when pressed late in his life to show how\\nthis status for them comported with the rest of his system, how they\\ncould be anything but modes of a single substance, in short how he\\navoided the drift into Spinozistic monism, he was in fact hard\\npressed.  In the Search After Truth, Malebranche clearly\\ncommitted himself to the view that everything is either a substance or\\na mode. In addition, he accepted Descartes’s criterion for a\\nsubstance that it be conceivable apart from everything else. However,\\nhe maintained that any given portion of extension is conceivable apart\\nfrom the rest of extension and is thus a substance. (Descartes did not\\nthink this, otherwise void space would be possible for him.) Since\\nextension is conceptually divisible to infinity, Malebranche is\\ncommitted to an infinite number of extended substances. Apart from the\\nwhole of extension, moreover, every substance contains an infinite\\nnumber of substances, of (each of) which it is a mode. It is also a\\npart of an infinite number of substances, which are modes of it. The\\nexplanatory value of the concept of substance would seem to have been\\nlost with such results as these. Malebranche’s view seems to be\\na degenerate version of Descartes’s texts to the effect,\\nsurprising but coherent, that there is but one material\\nsubstance, res extensa, whose modes are particular material\\nthings. Here the effect is to reverse the Aristotelian logic of\\nsubstance. To say of \\(x\\), a particular thing, that it is extended\\n\\(E\\), is to say not that a substance \\(x\\) has a property \\(E\\), but\\nthat \\(x\\) is a mode of\\nres extensa.</td>\n",

Dietrich gives a very precise answer\\nto this question based no doubt on his acceptance of Proclus’\\nexposition of the principles of generation within the hierarchy of\\nbeing. The agent intellect, according to this explanation, is the\\nintrinsic efficient cause of the soul. That it cannot be the material\\ncause Dietrich thinks is self-evident. It cannot be the final cause\\nsince a final cause perfects a thing, but does not establish it in\\nbeing, which is what the agent intellect does for the soul. But it is\\nmore important to understand, Dietrich insists, that the agent\\nintellect cannot be the formal cause of the soul—at least not in the\\nnatural order of things. He argues that if it was the formal cause of\\nthe soul, given that the soul by definition is the formal cause of the\\nhuman person, then it would follow that there would be a form of a\\nform in the same genus, man. But this is contrary to the natural order\\nof things because whatever is the form of something in the genus of\\nsubstance is by the whole of itself the act of its subject. Thus the\\nsame thing cannot be in potency to more than one form in its genus.\\nPerhaps we can understand Dietrich’s remarks about the vision of St.\\nBenedict mentioned above in terms of this analysis. Man is not\\n“fully joined” to his intellect in the sense that the\\nintellect is not his form. If it were his form, he, like Benedict,\\nwould understand the entire universe of beings in a single mental\\nact.

The extension of the\\ncategory composite things is all and only the things that\\nhave proper\\n parts.[12]\\n For some categories, difficult questions arise. Some of those\\nquestions involve the question of whether certain things are in the\\nextension of the category, e.g., is the Pope in the extension of the\\ncategory bachelor? Is a fetus in the extension of the\\ncategory person? Some questions concern the nature of the\\nthings falling under the category. The extension of the category\\nbook includes all and only the books. Does it include ebooks?\\nDoes it include some particular and well-loved copy of Material\\nBeings, with its stained pages and cover, or the abstract type of\\nwhich this particular copy is a token? Answering the Extension\\nQuestion leaves many other questions unsettled, one of which is the\\nnature of the things that are in the extension. But knowing which\\nthings are in the extension is a good start toward figuring out their\\nnature.</td>\n",

He pointed out that if one moves beyond the natural numbers\\nand climbs the hierarchy of types (the sets of natural numbers, the\\nsets of sets of natural numbers, etc.) one arrives at axioms (the\\naxioms of second-order arithmetic PA2, the axioms of third-order\\narithmetic PA3, etc.) that settle the undecided statements that he\\ndiscovered.  The axiom system for the second level, PA2, settles\\nthe statement left undecided at the first level, namely Con(PA);\\nin fact, PA2 proves Con(PA), which is the desired result.  But\\nnow we have a problem at the second level.  For the second\\nincompleteness theorem shows that (under similar background\\nassumptions to those above) PA2 does not settle Con(PA2).\\nFortunately, the axiom system for the third level, PA3, settles\\nthe statement left undecided at the second level, namely\\nCon(PA2).  This pattern continues.  For every problem there is a\\nsolution and for every solution there is a new problem.  In this way,\\nby climbing the hierarchy of types one arrives at systems that\\nsuccessively settle the consistency statements that arise along the\\nway.</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nRussell’s “No-Class” theory of classes from *20 of\\nPrincipia Mathematica provides a contextual definition like\\nthat of the theory of definite descriptions. One of Russell’s\\nearly diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all classes that are\\nnot members of themselves was that it showed that classes could not be\\nindividuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come across his paradox by\\napplying Cantor’s famous diagonal argument to show that there\\nare more classes of individuals than individuals. Hence, he concluded,\\nclasses could not be individuals, and expressions for classes such as\\n‘\\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\)’ cannot be the singular terms they appear\\nto be. Inspired by the theory of descriptions, Russell proposed that\\nto say something \\(G\\) of the class of \\(F\\)s, \\(G\\) \\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\),\\nis to say that there is some (predicative) property \\(H\\) coextensive\\nwith (true of the same things as) \\(F\\) such that \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). The\\nrestriction to predicative properties, or those which are not defined\\nin terms of quantification over other properties, was a consequence of\\nthe ramification of the theory of types to avoid intensional\\nor “epistemic” paradoxes which motivated the theory of\\ntypes in addition to the set theoretical “Russell’s\\nParadox” (see Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, Introduction,\\nChapter II). These predicative properties are intensional, however, in\\nthe sense that two distinct properties might hold of the same objects.\\n(See the entry on the\\n notation in Principia Mathematica.)\\n That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus\\nderivable, rather than postulated. If \\(F\\) and \\(H\\) are coextensive\\nthen anything true of \\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\) will be true of \\(\\{x:Hx \\}\\).\\nFeatures of classes then follow from the features of the logic of\\nproperties.</td>\n",

Closed morality and\\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\\nrules of closed moralities. Kant’s moral philosophy has its\\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that\\nthere be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although\\nKant’s categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is\\nnot, according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed\\nmorality really concerns the survival of a society, my society.\\nTherefore, it always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson,\\nclosed morality is always concerned with war. And static religion, the\\nreligion of closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the\\n“fabulation function.” The fabulation function is a\\nparticular function of the imagination that creates “voluntary\\nhallucinations.” The fabulation function takes our sense that\\nthere is a presence watching over us and invents images of gods. These\\nimages then insure strict obedience to the closed morality. In short,\\nthey insure social cohesion.   \n",

On one point Descartes’ position is clear:\\nthe claim of virtue to be the supreme good follows from the fact that\\nit is nothing more than the correct use of our free will, employing it\\nto choose whatever reason represents as the greatest good. As\\nDescartes argues in the Fourth Meditation, we are in no way more like\\nGod—that is, more perfect—than in our possession of free\\nwill. Hence the correct use of this will is our greatest good:\\n“free will is in itself the noblest thing we can have, since it\\nmakes us in a way equal to God and seems to exempt us from being his\\nsubjects; and so its correct use is the greatest of all the goods we\\npossess” (AT V 85/CSMK 326). Reason shows that the greatest good\\nwithin our power is the perfection of the will. In any choice we make,\\nthe value of the particular goods we pursue will always be less than\\nthat of the will itself; hence, provided we act virtuously, we can be\\ncontent, whether or not we succeed in obtaining whatever other goods\\nwe seek.   \n",

Three\\nlongstanding philosophical doctrines compose the theory: (1) the\\nPlatonic view that goodness is coextensive with reality or being, (2)\\nthe perfectionist view that the highest good consists in the\\ndevelopment and perfection of one's nature, and (3) the hedonist view\\nthat the highest good is pleasure. This set of doctrines is disclosed\\nin Leibniz's tripartite division of the good into the metaphysical\\ngood, the moral good, and the physical good (T §209, p. 258). He\\nequates the metaphysical good with reality, moral goodness with\\nvirtue, and the physical good with pleasure. Moreover, with each type\\nof good exists a correlative type of evil. The metaphysical good of\\nreality correlates with the metaphysical evil of privation of reality\\nor non-being. Similarly, the moral goodness of virtue relates to the\\nmoral evil of sin or vice. Finally, the physical good of pleasure is\\ncontrary to the physical evil of pain (T §21, p. 136). The theory\\nconstructed out of these divergent doctrines illustrates Leibniz's\\neclectic approach to philosophical investigation. As he puts it in a\\ncomment on his own system of philosophy, “This system appears to\\nunite Plato with Democritus, Aristotle with Descartes, the Scholastics\\nwith the moderns, theology and morality with reason. Apparently it\\ntakes the best from all systems and then advances further than anyone\\nhas yet done” (NE, p. 71).      \n",

Moreover, there is a close connection between a person’s\\nnatural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not\\nafterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable\\nterrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore\\nrespect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual\\nsentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection\\nbetween men and women, based on friendship and respect more than\\nsexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from\\nsexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing.\\nSexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding\\nthe physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a\\npropitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a\\nunion is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate\\nrelationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of\\ngeneration and to love for the collective community.   \n",

Beauvoir describes the intentionality of\\nconsciousness as operating in two ways. First, there is the activity\\nof wanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second, there is the\\nactivity of bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of\\nactivity consciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In\\nthe second, it uses its freedom to articulate meaning and give meaning\\nto the world. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with\\na mood: the first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods\\nof hope and domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality\\nbecomes the ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends\\non whether the mood of hope or domination prevails.   \n",

Sounds do have certain mathematically expressible accidents,\\nbut the science of proportions does not establish the substance or\\nnature of sounds. It bears only on those accidents. The two sciences\\nare not univocal, that is, they do not have the same subject. Rather,\\nthe subject of the higher science is an accident of the subject of the\\nlower science. So the subject of harmony is a certain kind of sound,\\nnot a certain kind of proportion.

To be\\nfungible is to be replaceable by another relevantly similar\\nobject without any loss of value. Thus, money is fungible: I can give\\nyou two $5 bills in exchange for a $10 bill, and neither of us has\\nlost anything. Is the object of love fungible? That is, can I simply\\nswitch from loving one person to loving another relevantly similar\\nperson without any loss? The worry about fungibility is commonly put\\nthis way: if we accept that love can be justified by appealing to\\nproperties of the beloved, then it may seem that in loving someone for\\ncertain reasons, I love him not simply as the individual he is, but as\\ninstantiating those properties. And this may imply that any other\\nperson instantiating those same properties would do just as well: my\\nbeloved would be fungible. Indeed, it may be that another person\\nexhibits the properties that ground my love to a greater degree than\\nmy current beloved does, and so it may seem that in such a case I have\\nreason to “trade up”—to switch my love to the new,\\nbetter person. However, it seems clear that the objects of our loves\\nare not fungible: love seems to involve a deeply personal commitment\\nto a particular person, a commitment that is antithetical to the idea\\nthat our beloveds are fungible or to the idea that we ought to be\\nwilling to trade up when\\n possible.[18]   \n",

The act of denial extends to the entire judgment; this\\nis expressed by the linguistic “not” attaching to the\\nverb. As Frege points out in his essay “Negation” (1918),\\nthis account does not neatly fit with the requirement that a false\\nthought be recognized as false. It seems that propositions must be\\naffirmed (as true) or denied (as a true negation). For example, to\\nrecognize that “3 is greater than 5” is false requires\\nhaving a complete thought, and not merely fragments of a thought.\\nSimilarly, there seems to be no room for true thoughts that have false\\nthoughts as their components, such as true conditionals with false\\nantecedents. In addition, the Logic seems to have trouble\\nwith double negation. If denying separates the thought into its parts,\\nthen double negation would function as a sword that magically unites\\nthe parts it had sundered (Frege 1918 [1952: 122–129]). From a\\nmodern perspective, the root problem in treating negation as denial is\\nonce again the failure to distinguish the thought or proposition that\\nis grasped from the act of judging it.   \n",

While he does claim that the only proper justification\\nof punishment is guilt for a crime, he does not limit the usefulness\\nof punishment to retributivist matters. Punishment can have as its\\njustification only the guilt of the criminal. All other uses of\\npunishment, such as rehabilitation (the alleged good of the criminal)\\nor deterrence (alleged good to society) uses the criminal merely as a\\nmeans (6:331). Once this guilt is determined, however, Kant does not\\ndeny that something useful can be drawn from the punishment. In the\\nFeyerabend lectures on Natural Right, Kant is clear that the sovereign\\n“must punish in order to obtain security”, and even while\\nusing the law of retribution, “in such a way the best security\\nis obtained” (27:1390–91). The state is authorized to use\\nits coercive force to defend freedom against limitations to freedom;\\nmore particularly, since right does not entail that citizens must\\nlimit their own freedom but only that “freedom is limited”\\nby conditions of right, it is right for another, i.e. the state, to\\nactively limit citizens’ freedom in accord with right (6:231).\\nThe state is authorized to use force to defend property rights\\n(6:256). Kant’s view, then, is that punishment of a particular\\nindividual may serve deterrent functions even when the punishment may\\nnot be based solely on deterrence as its justification.   \n",

Theists of a\\nmore traditional bent may view this as an indication of the inadequacy\\nof process metaphysics, for there is no provision for a\\nrun-of-the-mill coercive power in its concept of God. The idea that\\npersuasion plus coercion is a greater form of power than persuasion\\nalone ignores, however, a significant difference between God and the\\ncreatures. Every person has the power of persuasion and coercion (in\\ntheir ordinary senses), but neither of these powers involves a\\nviolation of the laws of nature. In order to attribute both forms of\\npower to God seems to require that God have the power to violate the\\nlaws of nature. That may not seem unreasonable since God, as\\ntraditionally conceived, acts miraculously in ways that break or\\nsuspend the laws of nature. Nevertheless, to speak, as Basinger does,\\nof a moral imperative to act coercively is tantamount, in the divine\\ncase, to demanding that the deity contravene the very laws that,\\naccording to traditional theism and process theism, it imposed in the\\nfirst place. There is an additional irony where the problem of evil is\\nconcerned. Traditional theists fault process theists for, in effect,\\nnot attributing to God the power to prevent gratuitous suffering.\\nTraditional theists, on the other hand, attribute this power to God\\nbut are obliged to argue that God is not at fault for not using it or\\nfor using it in ways that we find utterly baffling.   \n",

Before He created the world He foresaw all the pain and\\nmisery that it would contain; He is therefore responsible for all of\\nit. It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin.\\nIn the first place, this is not true; it is not sin that causes rivers\\nto overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt. But even if it were\\ntrue, it would make no difference. If I were going to beget a child\\nknowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac, I should be\\nresponsible for his crimes. If God knew in advance the sins of which\\nman would be guilty, He was clearly responsible for all the\\nconsequences of those sins when He decided to create man. (A1957, 22)\\n   \n",

The nub\\nof the matter concerns the relation between power and justice. For\\nPolus, the person who has power and wields it successfully is happy.\\nFor Socrates, a person is happy only if he or she is (morally) good,\\nand an unjust or evil person is wretched—all the more so,\\nindeed, if they escape punishment for their misdeeds. Polus finds this\\nposition “absurd” (473a1), and challenges Socrates to take\\na poll of all present to confirm the point. In sum: Plato’s suggestion\\nis that rhetoric and sophistry are tied to substantive theses about\\nthe irrelevance of moral truth to the happy life; about the\\nconventionality or relativity of morals; and about the irrelevance of\\nthe sort of inquiry into the truth of the matter (as distinguished\\nfrom opinions or the results of polls) upon which Socrates keeps\\ninsisting. Socrates argues for some of his most famous theses along\\nthe way, such as the view that “the one who does what’s unjust\\nis always more miserable than the one who suffers it, and the one who\\navoids paying what’s due always more miserable than the one who does\\npay it” (479e4–6). And if these hold, what use is there in\\nrhetoric? For someone who wishes to avoid doing himself and others\\nharm, Socrates concludes, rhetoric is altogether useless. Tied into\\nlogical knots, Polus succumbs.   \n",

It must, according to Beauvoir, embrace\\nthe ties that bind me to others and take up the appeal—an act\\nwhereby I call on others, in their freedom, to join me in bringing\\ncertain values, projects, and conditions into being. Artists and\\nwriters embody the ethical ideal in several respects. Their work\\nexpresses the subjective passion that grounds the ethical life. They\\ndescribe the ways that the material and political complexities of our\\nsituations can either alienate us from our freedom or open us to it.\\nBy envisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers\\nchallenge the mystifications that validate sacrificing the present for\\nthe future. They establish the essential relationship between my\\nfreedom and the freedom of others.   \n",

For him, this good is human good which ‘resides in\\nvirtue and the eudemonological appurtenances of virtue, and in general\\nin every good in so far as it is connected with virtue.’ He\\nconcludes, therefore, that every society, in so far as it is contrary\\nto virtue, is illegitimate because its aim is contrary to the essence\\nof society. At the same time, every law of society is invalid if, or in\\nso far as, it prevents members from achieving virtue. ‘Without\\nvirtue there is no human good, the end for which society is\\nestablished’ (PP, vol. 2, 189). But while anti-virtue is\\nessentially detrimental to the good of any society, virtue of itself is\\nnot the only element forming the good in question. Contentment of\\nspirit, that is, of the whole person, as distinct from passing pleasure\\nconfined to parts of human nature, is also included in every society’s\\nessential aim. Anything, therefore, opposed to contentment is\\ninevitably detrimental to society, whatever favour it may have found in\\npublic opinion. Rosmini finds support for this affirmation in Hamilton,\\nwhom he quotes approvingly (PP, vol. 2, 195).   \n",

As is clear, the response depends on an analogy between\\nbeing perfectly powerful (omnipotent) and being perfectly free. His\\nargument can be understood as follows. There are some things God\\ncannot do. He cannot make a square circle. Nor can he choose to do\\nevil. In the first case, his making a square circle is impossible\\nbecause the idea of a square circle is contradictory. In the second\\ncase, the contradiction is in the idea of a perfectly good being\\nchoosing to do evil. Since a contradiction is involved in each case,\\nGod's power is held to extend neither to making a square circle nor to\\nchoosing to do evil. For God's power extends only to what is not\\ncontradictory for a maximally perfect being to do. Clarke then claims\\nthat the fact that God's power does not extend to making a square\\ncircle or choosing to do evil does not imply any diminution of\\npower. And by analogy he infers that it does not imply any diminution\\nof liberty in God.   \n",

The compliance problem—the problem of justifying\\nrational compliance with the norms that have been accepted—must\\ndrive the justification of the initial situation and the conduct of\\nthe contracting situation. It is helpful to think of the contract\\nsituation as a bargain, in which each party is trying to negotiate the\\nmoral rules that will allow them to realize optimal utility, and this\\nhas led philosophers to apply a number of bargaining solutions to the\\ninitial contract situation. Gauthier’s solution is the “minimax\\nrelative concession” (1986, ch. V). The idea of minimax relative\\nconcession is that each bargainer will be most concerned with the\\nconcessions that she makes from her ideal outcome relative to the\\nconcessions that others make.

If a spectator sympathises with a recipient’s\\nresentment at the agent’s act then he judges the act\\ndemeritorious and the agent worthy of punishment. In the latter case\\nthe moral quality attributed to the act is injustice. An act of\\ninjustice “does a real and positive hurt to some particular\\npersons, from motives which are naturally disapproved of” (Smith\\n1790, p. 79). Since a failure to act justly has a tendency to result\\nin injury, while a failure to act charitably or generously does not, a\\ndistinction is drawn by Smith, in line with Humean thinking, between\\njustice and the other social virtues, on the basis that it is so much\\nmore important to prevent injury than promote positive good that the\\nproper response to injustice is punishment, whereas we do not feel it\\nappropriate to punish someone who does not act charitably or\\ngratefully. In a word, we have a stricter obligation to justice than\\nto the other virtues.   \n",

In the fourth Book of his\\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\\n(epithumêtikon). This terminology was also used by\\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\\nand concupiscibilis. Plato’s view of emotions was\\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\\naction-initiating impulses. Plato’s main reason for this\\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression.    \n",

When discussing modalities in his\\nOrdinatio (I, d. 38, 2), John Duns Scotus rejects a principle\\nwhich he calls an obligational rule, namely that with a false\\npositio one must “deny the present instant”. And\\nin fact, Walter Burley (writing roughly at the same time) mentions\\nthis as a valid, useful rule. The reasoning behind the rule is the\\nnecessity of the present. For example, suppose “you are\\nrunning” is the false positum when you are in fact\\nstanding in a university hall and participating in an obligational\\ndisputation. Now, if one considers the possibility that you are\\nrunning, this possibility must according to Burley be referred to some\\nother time, because of the necessity of the present. You cannot be\\nrunning now since you are standing now, but afterwards you can of\\ncourse run. (Kretzmann and Stump 1988, 394.)   \n",

The singular, and not the universal, is now\\nconsidered the first object of the intellect by origin—which\\nwas obvious from what had been stated in the previous passages. Being,\\ntaken in its broadest generality, is the first object of the intellect\\nby proportion, but now Burley explains that being, understood in this\\nway, is equivalent to intelligible being. The first object of the\\nintellect by intrinsic perfection is God. In this case as well, there\\nis a rather marked difference from the De anima commentary in\\nthat Burley abandons the distinction between absolute and relative\\nperfection (which had enabled him, once more, to introduce the\\nuniversal as primary object of the intellect), and replaces the more\\nimpersonal and abstract Aristotelian first cause with God (presumably\\nthe Christian God). Finally, the universal is the object of the\\nintellect by exclusion insofar as the intellect is the only faculty\\ncapable of knowing it.    \n",

On one\\nlevel, he explored the practice of methods of interpretation as an arc\\nleading from an initial situation and understanding to broadened\\nunderstanding, both of the interpreter and the world as a world we can\\nimagine ourselves as inhabiting. On a second level, he explored the\\nbroader notion of the fullness of language through investigation of\\ndifferent forms of extended discourse. These are uses of language that\\nare longer than a single sentence and whose truth and meaning is not\\nsimply reducible to the sum of the truth values of the individual\\nsentences which make up such extended discourse. On the basis of these\\ntwo interwoven levels, he could also take up the questions of selfhood\\nand responsible human action, allowing him to spell out in greater\\ndetail the ethical theory that had always been implicit in his\\nphilosophy. His discussion of ethics starts from a focus on person to\\nperson relations, the self and just one or only a few nearby others,\\ncharacterized in the best case by solicitude for the other person and\\nthe possibility of friendship, then subsequently moved on to the\\nquestion of justice and living with others beyond those we may meet\\nevery day or face to face. Here the question of rights and respect for\\nthe faceless other arises. The specific question what is a just\\nrelation in such situations (The Just, 2000; Reflections\\non the Just, 2007), developed out of Ricoeur’s\\nparticipation in a seminar for judges, and led to his reflections in\\nthe last work published during his lifetime on the idea of mutual\\nrecognition (The Course of Recognition, 2005). In those final\\nyears, he also continued to explore other dimensions of the fullness\\nof language, for example, through some significant essays on the\\nnotion of translation as occurring not just between languages but also\\nwithin them (On Translation, 2006).   \n",

Causal reasoning, by contrast, does\\ninfer matters of fact pertaining to actions, in particular their\\ncauses and effects; but the vice of an action (its wickedness) is not\\nfound in its causes or effects, but is only apparent when we consult\\nthe sentiments of the observer.

After the completion of his graduate study in physics,\\nSchlick soon turned his attention to philosophy (Schlick 2006a). \\nWithin a few short years he had written a youthfully enthusiastic\\nethical tract in 1908, called Lebensweisheit, a lucid analysis\\nof concept-formation called “The Boundaries of Scientific and\\nPhilosophical Concept-Formation” (1910), as well as a substantial\\nessay on “The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” (1910)\\n(Schlick 2006b; Schlick 1979a, 25–40, 41–103). In “The\\nBoundaries…”, Schlick provided a broad sketch of his\\nunderstanding of scientific thought, which identifies the aim of\\nscience as the reduction of phenomena to relationships governed by law,\\nthus exhibiting individual events as special cases of universal,\\nexceptionless regularities. Science is expressed mathematically, in\\nspatio-temporal form to provide for exact measurement. And the\\nindividual sciences are demarcated by distinctive intensive qualities,\\nas ‘mass’ distinguishes mechanics, ‘heat’\\nthermodynamics, etc. Although the methods of mathematico-scientific\\nconcept-formation reduces the entire natural world to purely\\nquantitative relations, it is powerless in the face of irreducible pure\\nqualities. This is the task of philosophy so that philosophy\\nbecomes the theory of qualities. Schlick’s work on\\n“The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” not only provides a\\nbroad survey of treatments of truth then current in German philosophy,\\nbut it also introduces an original view of truth as univocal\\ndesignation. A judgment, as a structured complex of its\\nconstituents, is coordinated with the fact which consists of the\\nentities signified by the judgment’s constituents, arranged in a\\nway which is coordinated with the structure of the particular\\njudgment. When the constituents are structured in a judgment so\\nthat the whole judgment univocally designates a situation in the world,\\nthen the judgment is true; otherwise, it is false. The conception\\nof truth as univocal coordination figured prominently in\\nSchlick’s pre-Positivist theory of knowledge.   \n",

A phenomenological description that extracts the\\n“essential features” from the phenomenon of cognition\\nwould note that: cognizers face off against something to-be-cognized;\\nthey attempt to “grasp” that something; they form an\\n“image” (broadly speaking) of that something; the image is\\nsomehow “determined” by the something; that something is\\nentirely untouched by the cognizer’s attempt to grasp it; they\\nmay or may not be in error about it (truth criterion); cognizers may\\nbecome conscious of problems surrounding the something; and they may\\nsucceed or fail in making cognitive progress regarding them (ME5a-i).\\nFrom among these factors, take the central feature of\\n“grasping.” The phenomenon of grasping generates an\\naporia: how does the mind go “out of itself” to grasp a\\ntranscendent object? The sense of being faced with something that one\\ndid not anticipate or create and that one must now “grasp”\\nis often simply backgrounded by antirealists who claim that the mind\\nunconsciously creates its objects, or is imprisoned in a circle of its\\nown “positings” (ME6a). This is a\\n“skeptical-subjectivistic” resolution to the aporia of\\ngrasping that simply ignores rather than does justice to the\\nphenomenon. It fails to distinguish between image and thing; what is\\ncurrently “objectified” in it; the object and the\\n“transobjective” (currently unknown but knowable); and\\nwhat may even be “transintelligible” (nonrational) in the\\nthing. Only by retaining the Kantian distinction between object\\n(appearance) and “thing-in-itself” can we account for this\\ncentral phenomenon of grasping. Far from being irrelevant, Hartmann\\nbelieves that the thing-in-itself is the “fundamental and\\neminently critical concept” (ME30a). It is needed to explain the\\nphenomenon of transcendence in the total phenomenon of cognition.\\nProblem consciousness, which entails “knowing that you\\ndon’t know,” implicitly recognizes what is transobjective,\\nand possibly transintelligible, in the thing. It implies a relation\\nbetween the subject as existing knower and something existing\\nindependently of it. The phenomenon of cognition overflows the domain\\nof epistemology into ontology.   \n",

The opening of\\nHeraclitus’ book refers to a “logos which holds\\n forever.”[3]\\n There is disagreement about exactly what Heraclitus meant by using\\nthe term logos, but it is clear from DK22B1/LM9D1, D110, and\\nR86 and DKB2/LM9D2 as well as DKB50/LMD46 and other fragments that he\\nrefers to an objective law-like principle that governs the cosmos, and\\nwhich it is possible (but difficult) for humans to come to understand.\\nThere is a single order that directs all things (“all things are\\none” DKB50/LMD46); this order is divine, and is sometimes\\nconnected by humans with the traditional gods (it is “both\\nunwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus”\\nDKB32/LMD45).

There are only four\\npossible relationships: the cause is the same as the effect, the cause\\nis different from the effect, the cause is both the same as and\\ndifferent from the effect, or the cause is neither the same as nor\\ndifferent from the effect. This fourth position would be tantamount to\\nsaying that there is no cause, and that an effect therefore arises out\\nof nothing at all. Each of these four possibilities is rejected in\\nturn, each for a different reason. Buddhapālita argues that if an\\neffect were identical to its cause, then it would already exist as the\\ncause and would have no need of coming into being a second time.\\nIdentity of cause and effect defeats the very idea of causality. If the\\neffect were different from the cause, on the other hand, then there would\\nbe no constraints on what could arise out of what, so long as the cause\\nand the effect were different. The third possibility is untenable, says\\nBuddhapālita, since it is merely the conjunction of the two\\nhypotheses that have just been shown to be untenable. A proposition\\nconsisting of the conjunction of two false propositions cannot be true.\\nThe fourth possibility, like the first, undermines the very idea of\\ncausality. Moreover, says Buddhapālita, it would render all\\npractice ineffectual; what he probably had in mind here was\\nspecifically Buddhist religious practice, which is predicated on\\nidentifying the root causes of dissatisfaction and then eliminating\\nthose root causes so that dissatisfaction disappears.   \n",

That is the aim of what is perhaps the most prominent\\nstrategy employed in recent theodicy, which is based on the concept of\\nfree will, and its importance in the plan of creation. The free will\\ndefense begins by distinguishing two kinds of evil. Moral\\nevil is evil that occurs through rational action — that is,\\nthrough wrongful exercises of will on the part of rational beings.\\nNatural evil, by contrast, is owing entirely to the operation\\nof natural causes. To see how this distinction works, we need to\\nrealize that moral evil can itself be divided into several categories.\\nFirst come exercises of will that are sinful in themselves, and these\\nare of two kinds. They include wrongful acts of intention formation,\\nas when one maliciously decides to kill another, and the volitional\\nactivity through which we execute wrong intentions — e.g., the\\neffort of will aimed at carrying out the intention to murder. The\\nmoral wrong of these exercises of will is intrinsic to them.\\nThey are sinful in themselves, and would be so even if, through some\\nfortuitous circumstance, the attempt to kill went awry, and the\\nintended victim was not harmed at all. Suppose, however, that the\\naction succeeds, as it does in most instances of wrongful willing. If\\nso, further evil will occur — in the present case, the death of\\nthe victim. Now if the victim had died entirely as a result of natural\\ncauses, his death would have counted as a natural evil. In this case,\\nhowever, it counts as a kind of moral evil, for while its occurrence\\nrequires the cooperation of natural causes, those causes are set in\\nmotion by the killer’s volitional activity. Harm and suffering\\nthat are caused by wrongful willing count as extrinsic moral\\nevil, in that they are caused by acts of will that are morally evil in\\nthemselves, or intrinsically.   \n",

The\\nstandard view tells us that religious reasons are never sufficient to\\njustify coercive law.

The main responses to the standard view divides\\ninto two types. Liberal critics of the view hold fast to the\\nprinciples of liberal democracy but reject the DRR—in part for\\nthe reason that the DRR is illiberal. New Traditionalists, by\\ncontrast, reject both liberal democracy itself and the DRR, viewing the\\nlatter as more or less a component of the former.

One of the more striking features of the text is its\\npredominantly philosophical flavor and its comparative lack of\\ntheological material. The principal question is devoted to the general\\nproblem of the eternity of the world. FitzRalph begins by putting\\nforward arguments against the beginning of the world in time. One goes\\nas follows: if God’s power is always the same, then it was the\\nsame before the world was created; therefore, God could always from\\neternity have produced the world. Thus, there is no contradiction in\\nstating that the world has always existed. FitzRalph attributes this\\nposition to the Commentary on the Sentences of Thomas Aquinas.\\nIndeed, he continues that, even if the world is not from eternity, we\\ncan argue that in the future God might make it so, since what he once\\ncan do, he can always do. In other words, it remains part of\\nGod’s power to make a universe that has always existed, just as\\nit remains possible for God to destroy this universe, or again, to\\ncreate other universes that have always existed.   \n",

During the Middle Ages logicians related their discipline to\\ntheology. One of the most important theological questions was the\\nproblem of the contingent future in relation to Christian doctrine.\\nAccording to Christian tradition, divine foreknowledge comprises\\nknowledge of the future choices to be made by men and women. But this\\nassumption apparently gives rise to a straightforward argument from\\ndivine foreknowledge to the necessity of the future: if God already\\nnow knows which decision I will make tomorrow, then a\\nnow-unpreventable truth about my choice tomorrow is already given.

If we say that words signify not only concepts but\\nthings external to and independent of the mind do we mean that\\n‘human being’ and ‘tall’ signify special\\ncommon objects such as humanity or tallness, or do we mean that they\\nsignify Socrates and his quality of being tall? For Aquinas, who did\\nnot want to give common natures any kind of intermediary existence\\nindependent of both concepts and actual things, the significate\\n(significatum) of a term was the intellect’s conception\\n(whether simple or definitional) of the thing signified; the thing\\nsignified (res significata) was usually the property or the\\nnature characterizing individual external objects; and the referent\\n(suppositum) was the individual external object itself,\\nviewed as the bearer of the property or nature. However,‘human\\nbeing’ cannot be said to  signify  Socrates, since the\\nmind cannot conceive physical individuals as such. In the fourteenth\\ncentury, further developments took place. There was a new focus on the\\nnotion of a mental language superior to spoken language, and concepts,\\nas parts of this mental language, were themselves regarded as having\\nsignification. Moreover, Scotists and nominalists agreed that, at\\nleast in principle, physical individuals could be conceived as such.\\nWilliam of Ockham and his followers not only denied the existence of\\ncommon natures but insisted that spoken words did not signify\\nconcepts. As a result, both spoken words and the concepts to which\\nspoken words are subordinated have the same significates, namely\\nindividual things and their individual properties, such as the\\ntallness of Socrates. Other nominalists, notably Buridan, insisted\\nthat spoken words did signify concepts as well as individuals, for\\nconcepts are required to mediate between spoken words and individual\\nthings.   \n",

Consider the prevention of\\nharm, or the prevention of moral wrongdoing. A number of writers\\nappeal to one or both values to justify the existence of criminal law\\n(Feinberg 1987, 146–155; Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 17; Simester\\nand von Hirsch 2011, 29–30). Because there are wrongless harms\\n(think of sporting injures caused without foul play) and harmless\\nwrongs (think of botched conspiracies or undiscovered attempts) the\\naforementioned values do not always wax and wane together. One\\npossibility is that criminal law’s concern with wrongs is\\nderivative of its concern with harms: criminal law should prevent\\nwrongs (e.g., conspiracy to injure) when and because harm is thereby\\nprevented (e.g., injury itself). Another possibility is that criminal\\nlaw’s concern with harms is derivative of its concern with\\nwrongs: criminal law should prevent harms (e.g., physical injury) when\\nand because those harms are wrongfully caused (e.g., by assault)\\n(Feinberg 1987, 151–155; Moore 1997, 647–649).

However, Abelard does not take ethical judgement to pose a\\nproblem. God is the only one with a right to pass judgement. Yet this\\nfact doesn’t prevent us from enforcing canons of human justice,\\nbecause, Abelard holds, human justice has primarily an exemplary and\\ndeterrent function. In fact, Abelard argues, it can even be just to\\npunish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. He cites\\ntwo cases. First, a woman accidentally smothers her baby while trying\\nto keep it warm at night, and is overcome with grief. Abelard\\nmaintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her\\npunishment may have on others: it may make other poor mothers more\\ncareful not to accidentally smother their babies while trying to keep\\nthem warm. Second, a judge may have excellent (but legally\\nimpermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself; since he\\ncannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on\\nthe basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he\\nbelieves to be innocent, is guilty. Human justice may with propriety\\nignore questions of intention. Since there is divine justice, ethical\\nnotions are not an idle wheel—nor should they be, even on\\nAbelard’s understanding of human justice, since they are the\\nmeans by which we determine which intentions to promote or discourage\\nwhen we punish people as examples or in order to deter others.   \n",

In what Nishida\\nalternatively called the logic of objects or subjective logic, objects\\nof consciousness are made the grammatical subject of propositions or judgments,\\nand are specified by predicating properties of the \\nsubject. Eventually a subject is reached that cannot itself be\\npredicated of anything else, recalling Aristotle’s\\nhypokeimenon or individual substance that can be subject but\\nnever predicate. Even when modern epistemology eschewed or at least\\nmodified Aristotle’s notion of substance as a substrate for contingent\\nproperties, it appealed to substrates in the sense that they define\\nthe primary subject of a judgment, that is, the judgment’s topic and grammatical subject.  Similar to phenomenologists,\\nNishida wanted to account for the consciousness that posits such\\nsubstances and underlies the subject of a judgment. Essays in From\\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and subsequent works\\ninvert Aristotle’s notion of the hypokeimenon and propose that\\nconsciousness is the “transcendental predicate” that can\\nnever be a subject; in other words consciousness in act can never be\\nmade an object of consciousness that could become a grammatical subject.  Nishida is aware of the paradox of\\nsuch formulations that would make consciousness the subject of\\nsentences that describe it, and he sometimes resorts to explicitly\\nparadoxical descriptions such as “seeing without a seer”\\nand “seeing the form of the formless, hearing the voice of the\\nvoiceless.” But he again also uses the straightforward metaphor,\\nthe “field of consciousness,” to indicate its\\nnon-subjective and non-objectifiable character. Consciousness cannot\\nbe grasped as the property of an individual substance nor as anything\\nlike a substance or underlying substrate itself. It functions as the\\nfield that is the opening of world and self.   \n",

The various\\ntranscendentals do not differ in reality, only in concept. The concept\\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.   \n",

In Whitehead’s view, God customizes the general\\npotentiality of the universe for each emergent occasion, providing it\\nwith its initial aim. The graded relevance of these potentialities\\nanswers to our sense that there are objectively better and worse\\noptions. A related problem is how the activities of the many\\nactualities that make up the cosmos happen to obey a common set of\\nnatural laws. Order implies an ordering power; however, all localized\\norder presupposes cosmic order; thus, order on a cosmic scale requires\\na cosmic ordering power. The best candidate for the cosmic ordering\\npower is God, according to Whitehead (Whitehead 1926 [1997, 104])—this\\nis a type of design argument. Another consideration is that the realm\\nof possibility in terms of which cosmic order is conceived is akin to\\nPlato’s Forms. In Whitehead’s system, these “eternal\\nobjects” require an ontological ground. The primordial nature of\\nGod serves this function (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 46]). Finally, the consequent\\nnature of God is the explanation of the fixity of accomplished fact\\nand achieved value. “The truth itself is nothing else than how\\nthe composite natures of the organic actualities of the world obtain\\nadequate representation in the divine nature” (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\\n12]). This sketch of Whitehead’s reasoning may suggest that his\\n“arguments” lose their force when abstracted from his\\nmetaphysics. Bowman L. Clarke, however, produced a formal theistic\\nargument along Whiteheadian lines using the linguistic framework\\ndeveloped by Nelson Goodman (Clarke 1966, 162–164). In a\\ndifferent vein, Franklin Gamwell argues that the moral law must be\\ngrounded in the divine good, where the divine good is most\\nparsimoniously conceived in neoclassical terms (Gamwell 1990). Another\\nprocess thinker, Derek Malone-France, argues that the promise of\\nKant’s transcendental philosophy is best fulfilled in a\\nWhiteheadian inspired theistic metaphysics (Malone-France 2007). Thus,\\narguing for the existence of Whitehead’s God, or something like\\nWhitehead’s God, need not be inextricably tied to evaluating\\nWhitehead’s metaphysics.   \n",

Primary qualities are the inseparable\\nfeatures of a body, e.g., its solidity, extension,\\nfigure, motion or rest, number, situation, etc. (II.viii.9 &\\n23). Secondary qualities are the colors, sounds, smells,\\ntastes, etc., of any object. These are secondary because\\nthese features of objects do not exist in the objects themselves, but\\nrather are nothing but the power of the primary qualities of the\\nobject to produce an idea in us of a certain kind (II.viii.10).

Finally, the tertiary\\nqualities of a body are those powers in it that, by virtue of its\\nprimary qualities, give it the power to produce observable changes in\\nthe primary qualities of other bodies, e.g., the power of the sun to\\nmelt wax is a tertiary quality of the sun (II.viii.23).   \n",

Unlike\\nclassical Christian theism which prioritizes transcendence by deriving\\ndivine immanence from divine transcendence, panentheism balances\\ndivine transcendence and immanence (Clayton 2020). In the classical\\nChristian understanding, divine transcendence is based on the\\nontological difference in substance between God and the world making\\ninteraction between the two distinct substances impossible (Schaab\\n2006, 547, 548). The panentheistic mutual relation also differs from\\npantheism which prioritizes divine immanence by identifying the\\ninfinite with the finite. The nature of this mutual relationship\\nbasically depends upon the understanding of the ontology of each\\nmember of the relationship. The issue is the nature of being for God\\nand for the world as the basis for mutual influence between God and\\nthe world. A variety of attempts have sought to describe the nature of\\nGod’s being and the world’s being in their relationship.\\nThomistic thought utilizes a concept of analogy as it wrestles with\\nthe nature of the being of God and the being of the world (Malloy\\n2014). Others in considering God’s action in the world posit the\\nnecessity of ontological difference between God and finite reality (M.\\nLeidenhag 2014, 219). Process thought directly addresses the issue of\\nontology by calling for an ontology that does not consider substance\\nas the basic type of existence because substance does not allow for\\ninternal relations (Bracken 2014, 10). According to Wesley Wildman the\\nrelations between entities are ontologically more fundamental than the\\nentities themselves for relational ontology in contrast to\\nsubstantivist ontology where entities are ontologically primary and\\nrelations derivative (2010, 55).   \n",

We should take\\nnote of a further difference between these two discussions: In Book X,\\nhe makes the point that pleasure is a good but not\\nthe good. He cites and endorses an argument given by Plato in\\nthe Philebus: If we imagine a life filled with pleasure and\\nthen mentally add wisdom to it, the result is made more desirable. But\\nthe good is something that cannot be improved upon in this way.\\nTherefore pleasure is not the good (1172b23–35). By contrast, in\\nBook VII Aristotle strongly implies that the pleasure of contemplation\\nis the good, because in one way or another all living beings\\naim at this sort of pleasure. Aristotle observes in Book X that what\\nall things aim at is good (1172b35–1173a1); significantly, he\\nfalls short of endorsing the argument that since all aim at pleasure,\\nit must be the good.   \n",

Later thinkers such as the Cambridge\\nPlatonists (Seventeenth century), Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758\\nCE) (Crisp 2009), and Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834 CE)\\nthought of the world as in some way in God or a development from God.\\nAlthough they did not stress the ontological distinction between God\\nand the world, they did emphasize the responsive relationship that\\nhumans have to God. Human responsiveness assumed some degree of human\\ninitiative if not freedom, which indicates some distinction between\\nGod and humans. The assumption of some degree of human initiative was\\na reaction against the loss of freedom due to Spinoza’s close\\nidentification between God and the world (J. Cooper 2006,\\n64–90).   \n",

In contrast, the theory of knowledge is limited to the\\nresearch and justification of “the most general and immediately\\nevident truths” (Stumpf, 1891, p. 501), such as laws and axioms\\nnecessary for knowledge. Yet, these axioms are nothing but\\npropositions that we assume to be true and necessary, and they have\\ntheir origin in the content of a specific class of psychical\\nfunctions, namely judgments. Since the contents of judgments are\\nformations or products (Gebilde) which, as we said, belong to\\neidology, the field of research of the theory of knowledge is\\ntherefore linked to that of this neutral science which also includes\\nstates of affairs. One must therefore avoid confusing the question\\npertaining to the nature of axioms with that of the psychological\\norigins of concepts, but one can no more entirely separate the theory\\nof knowledge from descriptive psychology since axioms are originally\\nthe contents of a specific class of psychical functions, i.e. the\\ncontents of judgments or of propositional attitudes whose\\njustification is the task of the theory of knowledge.

Already with Kant, it is asked whether we have\\nbesides analytic judgments also synthetic ones a priori, and\\nwhether the latter are perhaps, like the former, everywhere necessary\\nfor scientific progress. In contrast to leaving them empty and void\\nupon leaving the phenomenal sphere, however, it is clear that only\\npsychological investigation can decide this matter. It is a question\\nwhose answer is a prerequisite for every ontological and cosmological\\ninvestigation. Psychological experience and analysis is accordingly\\nalso that which leads to the source and the true sense of the most\\nimportant metaphysical concepts such as those of causality and of\\nsubstance. And as regards that problem which occupied Aristotle,\\nDescartes, and Leibniz so intensely, the question whether an analogue\\nof the understanding and the tactical will forms the last hidden cause\\nof all being and occurrence, it is obvious that this could not arise\\non any other basis but a psychological one. The concepts of the\\nunderstanding and the will are themselves taken from the domain of\\nmind. What Aristotle says here is confirmed, that what is the first\\nand earliest by nature is for our knowledge the last, for the area of\\npsychology, in which the greatest complication and dependence obtains\\nwith regard to its processes, is for us the starting point for the\\ninvestigation of what is most simple and independent.

An example of this sort of self-consciousness is\\nfound in the addict who may be very aware of how his desires are\\nruining his life. Once this sort of self-reflective awareness is\\nachieved it is then possible to think of changing things. In\\nBradley’s language this addict has pictured a better self that he\\nmight be, and if he comes to identify his satisfaction with realizing\\nthis better self there is a possibility of change. This situation\\nsets up a conflict between the actual person the addict now is and the\\nrepresented better person he wishes to be and this generates disharmony\\nor what Bradley often calls a “felt contradiction”.\\nThe pain of this conflict moves the individual toward resolving\\nit. It is important to note that the addict cannot move forward\\nwithout having a determinate ideal object, a definite conception of the\\nideal self being represented. Without this, identifying his\\nsatisfaction with realizing that state would be impossible.   \n",

The idea of\\nsubstance qua substance must be a perfect unity. However, the idea\\nwhich constitutes the human mind is complex—not a unity but a\\nplurality of ideas. That idea is therefore confused, rather than clear\\nand distinct. Clear and distinct understanding, on Spinoza’s\\naccount, must partake of the unity of the idea of substance, and not of\\nthe fragmentary nature of the idea of the human body and its\\naffects. This cognitive unity is achieved in two ways—through\\nreason (which Spinoza termed “knowledge of the second\\nkind”) and through intuition (“knowledge of the third\\nkind”). When we cognize through sensation and imagination\\n(“knowledge of the first kind”), we try to grasp many\\nideas at once, and thereby produce confusion. Reason and intuition, by\\ncontrast, provide us with access to just one idea—the\\nsubstantial unity underlying our body and our mind.

We have\\nalready remarked on one of these: their likeness to God and to the\\nuniverse of beings—a property shared by no other creatures. We have\\nseen that intellect is like God in that it is what we have called\\nsemi-creative or conceptional. In what way, however, can intellect be\\nthe likeness of the universe of beings, and to such a degree that it\\nbecomes identified with it so that we can say that the intellect is\\nthe universe of beings in the order of ens conceptionale? One\\ncould answer of course by saying that the intellect is this likeness\\nby its very act of knowing the universe of beings. But there is a\\ndifficulty here—one that Dietrich is well aware of from studying\\nAristotle. For the question how the intellect knows the universe of\\nbeings is like the question how the eye can see colors. If the eye\\nwere any one particular color, then it would see only that\\ncolor. Aristotle, who raises this question, replies that the eye must\\nbe colorless so it can see every color. Likewise for the mind or\\nintellect. Thus it is wrong to say that the intellect is the likeness\\nof the universe of beings by its very act of knowing the universe of\\nbeings because the very reverse is true. The intellect is no one of\\nthe beings it knows.  It is truly the universe of beings, but in the\\nconceptional order. Thus it can be like the universe of beings in the\\nso-called real order. Its nature then must be general and\\nuniversal. Noting its object provides evidence for this:   \n",

According to the Aristotelian conception,\\nscientific knowledge—scientia—is certain\\nknowledge of necessary truths, which can in principle be expressed in\\nsyllogistic form, the conclusion following from self-evident\\npremises. In the domain of natural philosophy, it is certain knowledge\\nof real essences. Although Locke does not seriously entertain a\\nradical skepticism—finding “a very manifest difference\\nbetween dreaming of being in the Fire, and being actually in it”\\n(E IV.ii.14, pp.537–538)—he recognizes that the demands\\nof scientia are too stringent for the new, experimental\\nscience.  Nevertheless, the concept of scientia plays an\\nimportant role as he develops his conception of the probabilistic sort\\nof knowledge that is possible for humans in the domain of natural\\nphilosophy: he uses it as a foil when explaining why humans must\\nsettle for probabilistic knowledge there, scientia remaining\\nalways out of reach. Scientia can serve as that foil because\\nit is attainable for human beings in certain domains; however Locke\\nthinks that for nobler spirits, such as angels, it is also attainable\\nwithin natural philosophy.   \n",

At its most basic, this\\nprinciple seems to be, for Du Châtelet, the principle that: for\\nany proposition P, if P implies a contradiction, then P is false (5\\nabove): ‘For, if one once granted that something may exist and\\nnot exist at the same time, there would no longer be any\\ntruth…’ (IP §4). According to Du Châtelet once\\nthis principle as stated is acknowledged, one can divide claims into\\nthe impossible and the possible: ‘It follows from this\\n[principle] that the impossible is that which implies contradiction,\\nand the possible does not imply it at all’ (IP §5). The\\npossibles include the possibilities from among which God created the\\nworld.   \n",

The\\ntechnological means available then and in the future are and would be\\nmore than enough to deal with any increases in population as long as\\ncapitalism is overcome.

For one, every event occurs. For another, events happen at times and places. Furthermore, as Chisholm sees it, when an event occurs, there must be some individual thing or things somehow participating in the occurrence of the event. These are the things that have the properties entailed by the event. The event is said to be “concretized” by those things. Finally, events may recur. John’s walking occurs when and where John walks; it occurs only if John has the property of walking. It can occur on many different occasions and in many different places. It may be an effect of some causes, and it may be a cause of some effects. Chisholm goes on to discuss the role of events in perception, causation, and explanation.   \n",

Spirit wholly lacks the power to create ex nihilo,\\nand God as pure spirit is utterly powerless in this sense. The power\\nof spirit lies in its ability to guide and direct the becoming of the\\nworld. God did not create the world, but allowed it to become (GW XI,\\n203). The world, i.e., life-urge, is the realizing factor of spirit\\nand, in allowing the world to become, God makes it possible for\\ngoodness to be realized. Hence, the becoming of the world is, by\\nvirtue of God’s love, agape. As the meeting place of\\nspirit and life, the human being is responsible for the becoming of\\nGod, and consequently for the realization of goodness. This task of\\nthe realization of God is one and same as the task of the realization\\nof the deeper spiritual values. As the deeper spiritual values are\\nrealized, existence takes on a more meaningful form and ultimately\\npoints to the deepest value, the divine. Scheler’s metaphysics\\nis the revelation of human responsibility in its most profound\\ndesignation. Whether human existence is the expression of the divine\\nor is merely relative to the basest of values depends solely on the\\nmanner in which human beings take responsibility for a future that is\\nopen. Rather than shift responsibility for the uncertain future to a\\nparticular religious practice or dogma, each person must live out the\\nwholly indeterminate becoming of the world, the human being and\\nGod.   \n",

It follows that ZFC+ ¬PM is mutually interpretable with\\nZFC.  But what about PM?  To show that ZFC+PM is mutually\\ninterpretable with ZFC a natural approach would be to follow the\\napproach used for CH and build an outer model of ZFC that\\nsatisfies PM.  However, it is known that this cannot be done\\nstarting with ZFC alone.  For it turns out (by a result of\\nShelah (1984)) that ZFC+PM implies the consistency of\\nZFC and this implies, by the second incompleteness theorem, that\\nZFC+PM is not interpretable in ZFC.  In a sense we have here a\\ncase of the independence of independence.  More precisely, even if we\\nassume that ZFC is consistent we cannot (in contrast to the case of\\nCH) prove that PM is independent of ZFC.  To establish the\\nindependence of PM from ZFC we need to assume the consistency of\\na stronger theory, namely, that of \\n ZFC + “There is a strongly inaccessible\\ncardinal”.  For it turns out that ZFC+PM lies not in the\\ninterpretability degree of ZFC but rather in that\\nof ZFC + “There is a strongly\\ninaccessible cardinal”.  To summarize: While CH is a case of the\\nsecond type independence, PM is a case of the first type independence;\\nit is similar to Con(ZFC) in that it is a sentence φ such that\\nonly one of φ or ¬φ leads to a jump in strength, only now\\nthere are two differences; the jump lands in a degree that is much\\nstronger and it is represented by a natural theory.   \n",

For, it is a common sight that saintly people\\nsuffer in their life, while habitual wrongdoers enjoy happiness. To\\naccount for such anomalies, a theory of rebirth is tagged to the\\nkarma-doctrine. The logic is somewhat like this: since nothing comes\\nfrom nothing, one must have done something good in the past, in this\\nlife or some other life, if one is happy; and, on the other hand, if\\none suffers then one must have done something wicked, if not in this\\nlife then in some other previous life. Although, with the exception of\\na few parapsychologists, nobody claims to have any scientific evidence\\nfor rebirth, yet this is a rational justification of the belief in\\nrebirth on the assumption that the universe is law-governed. The\\noverarching law that the philosophers in India believed in was called\\nṛta—the principle of cosmic order or harmony that\\n‘makes science possible, the world beautiful and the humans\\nmoral’. Ṛta is the principle underlying the\\n‘finely-tuned universe’, the transgression of which leads\\nto sin. It represents the totality of physical and moral laws, which\\neven the gods are bound to obey. The law of karma follows from\\nṛta as the causal basis of the phenomenal world. God is\\nconstrained so to act as to keep in view the accumulated karma of\\nindividuals, yet to bear fruit.   \n",

First, human excellence is a\\ngood of the soul – not a material or bodily good such as wealth\\nor political power. Another way to put this idea is to say happiness\\nis not something external, like wealth or political power, but an\\ninternal, psychological good. The second central idea is that the most\\nimportant good of the soul is moral virtue. By being virtuous one\\nenjoys a psychological state whose value outweighs whatever other\\nkinds of goods one might have by being vicious.   \n",

The\\nthought expressed by ‘The evening star is bright’ consists\\nof the sense of ‘the evening star’ and the sense of ‘is\\nbright’. (It should be noted that this claim about structure does\\nnot strictly follow from the fact that sense is compositional, i.e.,\\nthat the sense of a whole expression is fixed by the senses of its constituent\\nparts and their syntactic mode of arrangement.) In his late\\nmasterpiece, “The Thought” (1922), Frege is explicit about\\nthe nature of thoughts. They are not part of the outer realm, which\\nconsists of those entities perceivable by the senses. This Frege thinks\\nis obvious. Nor are they part of the inner realm, which consists of\\nideas. Unlike ideas, thoughts do not require an owner (i.e., they exist\\neven if not present in any mind), and can be present to more than one\\nmind. A third realm must be recognized, he tells us — a realm of\\nabstract eternal entities which we can grasp by virtue of our\\npower of thinking. However, Frege is explicit that thoughts do act:   \n",

One indisputably common element\\nbetween the two schools is the preoccupation with the problem of\\nvalidity, or Geltung, which is arguably the systematic core of\\nNeo-Kantianism in general (Krijnen 2001, 84). Philosophy for the\\nNeo-Kantians is concerned with the systematic elucidation of the a\\npriori principles that allow for valid thinking in various\\nspheres of knowledge. In keeping with Kant’s first\\nCritique, valid thinking is not merely logically consistent\\nthinking. Valid thinking requires, over and above the adherence to the\\nlaws of formal logic, thinking in accordance with the a priori\\nprinciples governing the intelligibility of a given area of reality.\\nThese will be, for instance, the principles of causality,\\nsubstantiality etc. in the sphere of physical nature and principles\\nsuch as good and evil, responsibility, freedom, etc. in the sphere of\\nethics. It is the task of philosophy to identify these a priori\\nprinciples in all the different spheres of culture, including politics,\\nbiology, art, history, etc. Helmuth Plessner captures metaphorically\\nthe spirit of Neo-Kantianism when he characterizes the Neo-Kantians as\\n“botanists in the garden of the a priori” (Plessner 1974,\\n185).   \n",

With Spanish irony, he structures his argument after\\nDescartes’ Meditations but arrives at an anti-foundationalist\\nconclusion. Drawing attention to what is given in an instant of\\nawareness (the smallest conceivable moment of consciousness), he\\nmaintains that any knowledge or recognition found in such an instant\\nwould have to be characterized by a concept (or “essence”\\nto use Santayana’s term). Concepts cannot be limited to particular\\ninstances; rather the particular object is seen as an instance of the\\nconcept (essence). Thus, pursuing doubt to its ultimate end, one is\\nconfined by the “solipsism of the present moment.” That is,\\nin a single instant of awareness there can be no knowledge or belief,\\nsince both require concepts not bounded by a moment of awareness.\\nHence, the ultimate end of doubt, an instance of awareness, is empty.\\nIt is the vacant awareness of a given without a basis for belief,\\nknowledge or action. Santayana concludes that if one attempts to find\\nthe bedrock of certainty, one may rest his claim only after he has, at\\nleast theoretically, recognized that knowledge is composed of instances\\nof awareness that in themselves do not contain the prerequisites for\\nknowledge, e.g., concepts, universals, or essences.

In\\nkeeping with the principles of theological Trinitarianism, God is\\ndescribed by Cardano in terms of power (potestas), mind\\n(mens), and love (amor), and these attributes are not\\n“three gods, as Plotinus thinks,” but original divine\\nattributes. The natural world is a constant reminder that God’s\\n“threefold and undivided life” flows into each single\\nthing, down to the smallest beings (ad minima usque) (De\\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). However, for all the layers and\\nmediations that characterize Cardano’s universe, the distance\\nbetween human beings and God remains unbridgeable. Man cannot reconcile\\nthe finite with the infinite, for “no finite thing can be\\ntransformed into an infinite nature.” Cardano rules out that\\n“this life of ours can get close to that which truly is,”\\nfor there is no proportion and no resemblance between the two levels of\\nbeing. Echoing Cusanian motifs, he argues that “everything that\\nis understood by a finite being is finite, for the act of understanding\\n(comprehensio) occurs through some proportion; but there is no\\nproportion between the infinite and the finite.” Likewise, our\\neyes cannot grasp the direct light (lux) of the sun, but only\\na glimpse of its brightness (lumen) (De arcanis\\naeternitatis, OO, X, 4b–5a). Such a powerful and all-encompassing\\nview of divine and natural order, in which the presence of latent\\nPlatonic and Averroist motifs contributes to strengthen the cogent\\norganization of the whole universe, has inevitable repercussions\\nconcerning the meaning of moral action. During his life, Cardano\\ndevoted a considerable number of works to ethical inquiries, surveying\\nalmost every aspect in the field: theoretical ethics, applied ethics,\\nprudential behaviour, consolation, education, and the role of rhetoric.\\nHowever, his most important contribution to moral philosophy consists\\nin his attempt to redefine the relationship between the universal scope\\nof practical reason and the need for human beings to apply moral laws\\nto the concrete circumstances of their life. This characteristic\\ntension between knowledge and application is particularly evident in\\ntwo works: Theonoston (which Cardano began to write around\\n1555) and De utilitate ex adversis capienda (published in\\n1561).   \n",

In accordance with his methodology, he tries to at\\nleast partially characterize the notion by stating a number of theses\\nabout it that he considers to be true. To begin with, he claims that\\nonly true propositions stand in the relation of ground to consequence.\\nPerhaps unwisely, he assumes uniqueness: “there is only one\\nobjective ground [for a given truth]” (TS IV:\\n§528; cf. §206). In many cases, the ground consists of a\\ncollection of truths. The parts (members) of this collection are\\ncalled partial grounds, the collection the complete or total ground.\\nSimilarly, Bolzano distinguishes between the total and merely partial\\nconsequences of a given ground. In modern terms, we would take the\\nrelation he describes to be one that holds between two sets, an option\\nnot open to Bolzano because, on his understanding, a collection must\\ncontain at least two parts.   \n",

Identifying this good as\\nhappiness, he immediately notes the variations in the notion\\n(1095a15–25). Some think the happy life is the life of\\nenjoyment; the more refined think it is the life of political\\nactivity; others think it is the life of study or theoretical\\ncontemplation (1095b10–20). The object of the life of enjoyment\\nis bodily pleasure; that of political activity is honor or even\\nvirtue. The object of the life of study is philosophical or scientific\\nunderstanding. Arguing that the end of human life must be the most\\ncomplete, he concludes that happiness is the most complete end.\\nWhereas pleasure, honor, virtue, and understanding are choice-worthy\\nin themselves, they are also chosen for the sake of happiness.\\nHappiness is not chosen for the sake of anything else\\n(1097a25–1097b5). That the other choice-worthy ends are chosen\\nfor the sake of happiness might suggest that they are chosen only as\\ninstrumental means to happiness, as though happiness were a separate\\nstate. However, it is more likely that the other choice-worthy ends\\nare constituents of happiness. As a consequence, the happy life is\\ncomposed of such activities as virtuous pursuits, honorable acts, and\\ncontemplation of truth. While conceiving these choice-worthy ends as\\nconstituents of happiness might be illuminating, it does, in turn,\\nraise the issue of whether happiness is a jumble of activities or\\nwhether it requires organization – even prioritization –\\nof the constituents.   \n",

We can\\ndistinguish three periods in his writing (van der Linden 1988,\\n205–6; Bonaunet 2004: 22ff). The first, early period is\\ncharacterized by Cohen’s attempts to develop his own views as\\ncommentaries on Kant. During this period, he wrote Kant’s\\nTheory of Experience, Kant’s Foundations of\\nEthics, and Kant’s Foundations of Aesthetics. The\\nsecond period marks Cohen’s mature philosophical work, which\\ntook the form of his multi-volume System of Philosophy. In\\nthe System, Cohen explicitly abandoned central Kantian\\ndoctrines, and presented his views systematically, and as his own,\\nrather than offering them as interpretations of Kant.

The eternal truths are just this essence of created\\nthings. As before, Descartes did not elaborate his answer, but, once\\nagain, he provided enough elsewhere for us to do so. It is clear that\\nfor Descartes, as for many other theologically orthodox thinkers, the\\nexistence of things results from an unconstrained exercise of God’s\\nomnipotent will to create ex nihilo.

Creatures are existent, good, wise, only by sharing in\\nGod’s existence, goodness, and wisdom, and this sharing has\\nthree features. It involves a separation between the creature and what\\nthe creature has; it involves a deficient similarity to God; and it is\\nbased on a causal relation. What is essentially existent or good is\\nthe cause of what has existence or goodness by participation.

Nature is depicted as a mechanical machine and\\nshould be studied by the natural sciences. Abstract economic\\ntheory is the mechanical analogy of these natural sciences: it is\\nrestricted to an investigation of the social world as a mechanical\\nmachine, and no ethical or religious considerations are taken into\\naccount. Jevons refutes the claims of some “sentimental\\nwriters” who regard economics as a “dismal science”,\\nbecause its scope is restricted to wealth. These authors depict\\neconomics as a mechanical and miserable body of theories, whereas they\\nhold true that a moral science should be concerned with sympathies,\\nfeelings and duties. Jevons uses an analogy from the natural\\nsciences to refute this opinion: division of labour implies that some\\npeople investigate the mechanical aspects of iron, while other\\nresearchers devote their time to the study of its electrical or\\nmagnetic aspects. A physician may conclude that the health of a\\nparticular person will be fostered if he goes to the sea, but this\\nperson may decide otherwise by taking other considerations into\\naccount. This is the position of economics: charity for\\nhumanitarian reasons remains possible, but abstract economic theory\\nshows that this may endanger future accumulation of wealth (Black\\n1977d, pp. 7–8).   \n",

The plight of\\nthe oppressed was tied to a sense of the aesthetic. Indeed,\\nAddams’ valorization of art and culture, as exhibited in the\\nappearance and activities of Hull House resonates with Ruskin’s\\naesthetics. For Addams, “Social Life and art have always seemed\\nto go best at Hull House” (STY 354). Addams viewed art and\\ncultural activities as reinforcing essential human bonds (DSE 29).\\nRuskin also influenced Arnold Toynbee and other future settlement\\nworkers by identifying the problems in large industrial cities and\\ncalling for reforms foreshadowing the safety nets typical of later\\nwelfare states. Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of\\nself-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she\\nsought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For\\nexample, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or\\ncame in late for work because “all human interest has been\\nextracted from it” (SYC 129). Although Addams valued\\nRuskin’s moral imagination, the concept of labor, and ideas\\nabout transforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his\\nromanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in\\nsocial progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For\\nAddams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions, even\\nregarding moral philosophy.   \n",

The\\nattributes of the essence of God divide themselves only within the\\npersonas of the Trinity.

One way to understand it is to\\ncompare it to a causal principle that Descartes invokes in his\\nargument for God’s existence in the Third Meditation. He claims\\nthat the objective reality of an idea (such as that of God) must have\\na cause with at least as much formal reality. Using this\\nprinciple, he concludes that only a being with infinite formal reality\\ncan be the cause of the (infinite) objective reality of my idea of\\nsuch being. Now, Malebranche is not concerned with causes in this\\ncontext but with what is required for something to be present to the\\nmind; nevertheless, he is making the same general point: something\\ncannot give what reality it does not have. In perceiving a general\\nidea, such as a circle, we are able to perceive an infinite number of\\npossible diameters (and thus an infinity of possible particular\\ncircles). Thus, the general idea of circle contains an infinite degree\\nof reality. If this idea were a modification of my mind, my mind\\nitself would have to be infinite, which it clearly is not.   \n",

In Quodl. I, q. 14, the eminence of the will over\\nthe intellect is defended, taking into account the habitus,\\nact and object of the two faculties. As in Pauline doctrine, the\\nhabitus of the will, which is love (caritas), is\\npreferable to the habitus of the intellect, which is\\nknowledge. Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\\nGod. The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\\n“primacy of essence” should be attributed to\\nvoluntas, whereas “primacy of action” should be\\nattributed to ratio.   \n",

It seems to depend on\\na particular way of thinking about the world and what is beyond the\\nworld. Both world and agent need to be thought of in terms of effect\\nand receptivity to effect; and then the Beyond needs to be conceived\\nin analogy and contrast with this aspect of the world, in its relation\\nto the agent (subject of the feeling). A person who did not engage in\\nthis process of thought, at least covertly or subconsciously, would\\nnever get to the feeling of absolute dependence as Schleiermacher\\ndescribes it. 2) Schleiermacher is a Christian theologian and thinks\\nhe has given an account of the most basic experience of God. But any\\nGod who existed would be part of the “world” on\\nSchleiermacher’s conception and thus could not be the object of the\\nfeeling of absolute dependence. Furthermore, the God of Christian\\ntradition is not utterly incapable of being affected by human beings.\\nGod responds to states of the world with actions and emotions, and\\nhears and answers prayer. 3) Absolutizing the dependency relationship\\nin the way that Schleiermacher does seems to evacuate\\n‘dependency’ of its usual meaning. The “other”\\ntowards which one feels absolutely “dependent” in\\nSchleiermacher’s conception must be predicateless to protect it\\nagainst any influence (in particular, epistemic contact) from the side\\nof the world; but that move eliminates any positive sense in which we\\ndepend on it. Absolute dependence in the object comes to equal\\nabsolute incapability of being affected, and the feeling of absolute\\ndependence amounts to a feeling of complete lack of effective agency\\nvis-à-vis the other — that is, it becomes a\\npurely negative conception. So the feeling of absolute dependence\\nmight better be called the feeling of absolute impotence.   \n",

He suggests three “objective”\\nreasons for this lag: first, metaphysics’ greater reliance upon\\narbitrary signs (signs that do not essentially coincide with what is\\nsignified); second, the holistic content of metaphysics (no quality\\ncan be defined without an adequate insight into the others); and\\nthird, metaphysics’ need to establish the actual existence of\\nwhat corresponds to the analyzed concepts. Thus, for Mendelssohn,\\nmathematical truths need not suppose more than the appearances of\\nthings as long as a distinction is maintained between constant and\\ninconstant appearances or, equivalently, between appearances that have\\ntheir basis in the intrinsic, essential constitution of our senses and\\nthose that do not (e.g., those due to sickness or a faulty\\nperspective). “Thus, even in the system of a doubter or an\\nidealist, the value of not only pure, theoretical mathematics but even\\npractical and applied mathematics remains, and it retains its\\nundeniable certainty” (Philosophical Writings, p. 268).\\nMetaphysics, by contrast, requires a resolution of the problem of\\nidealism.   \n",

In Quodl. I, q. 14, the eminence of the will over\\nthe intellect is defended, taking into account the habitus,\\nact and object of the two faculties. As in Pauline doctrine, the\\nhabitus of the will, which is love (caritas), is\\npreferable to the habitus of the intellect, which is\\nknowledge. Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\\nGod. The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\\n“primacy of essence” should be attributed to\\nvoluntas, whereas “primacy of action” should be\\nattributed to ratio.   \n",

To regard something as normative\\nis to regard it as justified, as a warranted requirement on practical\\ndeliberation. However, the difference resides in the difference in\\npoints of view. Each basic norm determines, as it were, a certain point\\nof view. So it turns out that normativity (contra Kant) always consists\\nof conditional imperatives: if, and only if, one endorses a\\ncertain normative point of view, determined by its basic norm, then the\\nnorms that follow from it are reason giving, so to speak. This enables\\nKelsen to maintain the same understanding of the nature of normativity\\nas Natural Law’s conception, namely, normativity qua reasons for\\naction, without having to conflate the normativity of morality with\\nthat of law. In other words, the difference between legal normativity\\nand, say, moral normativity, is not a difference in normativity (viz,\\nabout the nature of normativity, per se), but only in the relevant\\nvantage point that is determined by their different basic norms. What\\nmakes legal normativity unique is the uniqueness of its point of view,\\nthe legal point of view, as it were.   \n",

It does not stand in any relation with\\nprakṛti, which comprises the material world, including\\nmental processes. Nevertheless, puruṣa forms the\\nfoundation of prakṛti. This means that\\npuruṣa provides the meaning for all material processes.\\nThus prakṛti exists for puruṣa and it is\\nonly because of this that the world is not simply a collection of\\nmeaningless physical processes. In addition, the intellect as part of\\nprakṛti is supposed to realize that it is not\\nconsciousness and it is to become aware of pure consciousness as the\\nway to liberation. This means that the intellect is supposed to\\nunderstand the contentless pure consciousness but of course in order\\nto do so it would have to become contentless itself, which seems\\nimpossible. Therefore, the intellect can only achieve this in an\\nindirect way without cognition. Instead, we require meditative or\\nyogic exercises to understand the difference between\\npuruṣa and prakṛti.   \n",

However, not all\\narguments were equally compelling in his view. In the Prize\\nEssay he contends that probable arguments for God’s\\nexistence based upon beauty, order, and design are more eloquent and\\nedifying but less certain and convincing than strict demonstrations.\\nSimilarly, in Morning Hours, he cites the argument that the\\nexternal senses’ testimony to an external world is unthinkable\\nwithout a necessary, extra-worldly being, but adds that this sort of\\nargument would hardly convince an idealist, sceptic, or solipsist.\\nThere are, however, at least two ways in which, according to\\nMendelssohn, God’s existence can be established with certainty.\\nThe first way is through application of the principle of sufficient\\nreason to the certain existence of contingent things. The inner\\ntestimony of one’s own cogito attests to the existence of\\nsomething contingent. Since the sufficient reason for the existence of\\ncontingent things must “indirectly” be a necessary being,\\na necessary being exists. Hence, Mendelssohn sums up this argument by\\nsaying: “I am, therefore there is a God.”\\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 289; Gesammelte\\nSchriften, 3/2, pp. 78, 83f).   \n",

In process\\nmetaphysics no actual entity is wholly determined by the activity of\\nanother; or phrased positively, every actual entity retains\\nsome power of self-determination, however minimal or slight\\nit may be. According to this view, to have power in relation to others\\nis to have power in relation to other entities with some degree of\\npower. This is process philosophy’s doctrine of universal\\ncreativity. Hartshorne says, “To be is to create”\\n(Hartshorne 1970, 1, 272). The logic of the matter does not change if\\nGod is included in the metaphysical scheme. For process theism, God is\\nthe supreme or eminent creative power, but not the only creative\\npower. Thus, process theists speak of God and the creatures as\\nco-creators (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000, 140]; Hartshorne 1967a,\\n113).   \n",

According to Kant, concubinage is the\\nnon-commodified sexual relationship between a man and more than one\\nwoman (the concubines). Kant takes concubinage to be a purely sexual\\nrelationship in which all parties aim at the satisfaction of their\\nsexual desires (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 166). The inequality\\nthat is involved in this relationship makes it problematic. Kant\\nexplains that “the woman surrenders her sex completely to the\\nman, but the man does not completely surrender his sex to the\\nwoman” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 169). Since body and\\nself are for Kant inseparable and together they constitute the person,\\nin surrendering her body (her sex) exclusively to her male partner,\\nthe woman surrenders her whole person to the man, allowing him to\\npossess it. The man, by contrast, who has more than one sexual\\npartner, does not exclusively surrender himself to the woman, and so\\nhe does not allow her to possess his person. In allowing her male\\npartner to possess her person, without herself being able to similarly\\npossess his person, Kant believes that eventually the concubine (and\\nthis also applies to the woman in any other polygamous relationship,\\nincluding polygamous marriage) loses her person and is made\\n‘into a thing’ (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\\n166).   \n",

The good operates metaphysically\\nas the final cause of the order of forms in the universe of beings. But\\nit is also the First Cause. And its operation in the created order of\\nbeing is discovered as an attraction of all being back to itself.\\n“We exist because God is good,” Albert explains, “and\\n we are good insofar as we\\n exist.”[6]\\n Thus the balanced relations of the exit and return of all things\\naccording to classical Neo-Platonism is skewed in favor of the\\nrelationship of return. This is because Albert, as a Christian\\nphilosopher, favors a creationist view of being over the doctrine of\\npure emanation. Rejecting also the doctrine of universal hylomorphism\\nAlbert argues that material beings are always composite in which the\\nforms are inchoate until they are called forth by the ultimate\\ngood. Spiritual creatures (excluding man) have no material\\nelement. Their being summoned to the good is immediate and final. The\\nsummoning of the inchoate forms of material beings, however, is not\\ndirect. It depends upon the intervention of the celestial spheres.   \n",

Abner had an original view on the\\nTrinity. In his opinion, one can prove philosophically the reality of\\nthe\\n Trinity.[14]\\n He claimed that only the division of the divine source of the world\\ncan explain the diversity of the world. The infinite force of God (the\\nfather) would burn the finite matter of the world if it were not for\\nsome “transformer” that adapted the divine force to the\\nfinitude of matter (the son). Abner distinguished between two parts of\\nthe son. The superior son is part of the transcendent divinity. The\\ninferior son is the divine essence in all the different parts of the\\nworld. The transformer of the divine force and essence is the superior\\nson.   \n",

This is so because of the identity of the Good with the One.\\nBecause all entities only appear by virtue of participation in the One,\\nand because the One, taken in itself, is a pure Good, the Good is also\\ndeemed to be the ultimate source and the super-simple reference point\\nof the universe. To characterize the Good, Petrizi adduces and uses\\nprinciples from Plato’s Phaedrus, treating the various degrees\\nof goodness. The first Good heads the Good, and thereafter follow the\\nvarious levels of goodnesses. The good is also deemed to be the\\nprinciple of order and structuring of Being. That which is first to be\\nlinked to it has traces of the Good in itself, and the first\\nmonads also have such a nature. It is precisely in these first entities\\nthat Beauty and the Good are found (Petrizi, Opera II, prop.\\n8, p. 34).   \n",

We can assign positive numbers to the good parts and negative numbers to the bad parts in order to represent their respective amounts of intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of the whole state of affairs may just be the sum of the values of those parts. In such cases Chisholm would say that the positive value of the good parts is “balanced off” by the negative value of the bad parts.   \n",

The Logic\\ncondenses this framework so that the significance of general ideas has\\ntwo aspects: the comprehension and the extension.\\nThe comprehension consists in the set of attributes essential to the\\nidea. For example, the comprehension of the idea\\n“triangle” includes the attributes extension, shape, three\\nlines, three angles, etc. The extension of the idea consists in the\\nparticular objects to which it applies, which includes “all the\\ndifferent species of triangles” (I.6, 39–40). Here the\\nauthors confuse matters by trying to incorporate the traditional terms\\n“inferiors” and “species”, taking the latter\\nfor individual objects. Usually, however, they straightforwardly take\\nthe extension of a general idea to be the individuals possessing the\\nattributes in its comprehension. There are three key features of this\\ntheory of signification. First, the comprehension rather than the\\nextension is essential to the function of a general idea: one cannot\\nremove an attribute without destroying it—making it into a\\ndifferent idea, whereas one can restrict its extension by applying it\\nto only some of the objects that fall under it. Second, the\\ncomprehension governs the extension: the set of attributes determines\\nthe individuals in its extension. Finally, comprehensions and\\nextensions are inversely related. In adding attributes to the\\ncomprehension of an idea one restricts its extension. For example, the\\ncomprehension of the idea “mammal” includes that of the\\nidea “animal” so the extension of “animal”\\nincludes that of “mammal.” The Logic implicitly\\nassumes this principle throughout the text. In recognizing these two\\nmodes of the signification of words—both the comprehension of\\nthe associated idea and the objects in the extension—it replaces\\nthe traditional distinction between incomplete and complete entities\\nin the treatment of the signification of general terms.   \n",

Not\\nsurprisingly, however, he replaces the Stoic logos with the\\nChristian logos or “Word of God” from the Gospel\\nof St John. Our own individual natures, as parts of nature or God,\\nfunction in the same way as do souls in the human body: they are God\\ndwelling in the human frame (Manuductio II.19). By\\nidentifying the Stoic logos with the Christian God, Lipsius\\nis able to conclude, along with Cicero and Clement of Alexandria, that\\nthe Stoic supreme good is equivalent to faith in God. Virtue and\\nwisdom come from the source of all knowledge: God. The Platonic\\ncontemplation of the Good and the Stoic exploration of the\\nrelationship of individual to universal nature are both tantamount to\\nthe study of God and his logos, Christ. Therefore, the virtue\\nwhich the Stoics regard as the summum bonum is the right\\nattitude towards God; and this virtue is the only way to achieve the\\ngood life (Manuductio II.19).   \n",

In the last\\ncompleted essay, “The Logic of Place and the Religious\\nWorldview” (1945), Nishida is more experiential. Death is not an\\nevent at the end of one’s life but penetrates life at each and every\\nmoment. It is the ever-present opening, so to speak, where one’s utter\\nfinitude can come to light. Insofar as this is the finitude of the\\nindividual self, it also implies a logic of individuation where the\\nrole of other relative selves is diminished. “I am myself by\\nknowing my own death” (NKZ XI, 420) is both a declaration of\\nexistential self-awareness and a statement of what makes me uniquely\\nme. What makes me an individual is not merely my differences from\\nothers nor my sameness with some essential core; it is precisely what\\nmost makes me not me, what negates me, in any moment\\nof action. In this context, death signifies the self-negation of the\\nfinite self.   \n",

This second definition is less metaphysical and more political. In “Force of Law,” Derrida says that deconstruction is practiced in two styles (Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice, p. 21). These “two styles” do not correspond to the “two phases” in the earlier definition of deconstruction. On the one hand, there is the genealogical style of deconstruction, which recalls the history of a concept or theme. Earlier in his career, in Of Grammatology, Derrida had laid out, for example, the history of the concept of writing. But now what is at issue is the history of justice. On the other hand, there is the more formalistic or structural style of deconstruction, which examines a-historical paradoxes or aporias. In “Force of Law,” Derrida lays out three aporias, although they all seem to be variants of one, an aporia concerning the unstable relation between law (the French term is “droit,” which also means “right”) and justice.   \n",

If God is unaffected by the\\ncreatures, then God is impassible, not moved by their suffering.\\nAnselm, in Proslogion chapter VIII, asks how God can be\\ncompassionate towards the creatures without feeling sympathy for them.\\nHis answer—in effect a kind of theological behaviorism\\n(Dombrowski 2006, 140)—is that the creatures feel the effects of\\ndivine compassion but that God feels nothing. This leaves unanswered\\nhow non-sympathetic compassion is possible. Aquinas provides a less\\nobviously question begging reply. He says that to love another is to\\nwill the good of the other; God necessarily wills the good of the\\nother, so God is love (Summa Theologica I, Q 20, a. 2).\\nProcess theists do not deny that love requires willing the good of the\\nother, but they maintain that it requires something more, or at very\\nleast that there are greater forms of love of which willing the good\\nof the other is a necessary aspect. Divine love is more than\\nbeneficence; it includes sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the\\nbeloved. This idea is expressed in Whitehead’s depiction of God\\nas “the great companion—the fellow-sufferer who\\nunderstands” (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 351]). Hartshorne points out that\\nAnselm’s God can give us “everything except the right to\\nbelieve that there is one who, with infinitely subtle and appropriate\\nsensitivity, rejoices in all our joys and sorrows in all our\\nsorrows” (Hartshorne 1948, 54).   \n",

Does it include ebooks?\\nDoes it include some particular and well-loved copy of Material\\nBeings, with its stained pages and cover, or the abstract type of\\nwhich this particular copy is a token?

There is, of course, a prior question of why\\nthe decisions of courts should be regarded as making law at\\nall. In some Civilian legal systems, such as the French, the official\\nview is that court decisions do not make law, they merely involve the\\napplication of the law. This follows from a straightforward\\nunderstanding of the separation of powers: the responsibility of the\\nlegislator is to make law, the responsibility of the judiciary is to\\nfaithfully apply the law made by the legislator. For the courts to\\nmake law would be to usurp the legislative function, and to usurp a\\nfunction to which the courts have no legitimate claim. One distinctive\\nfeature of Common Law systems is the existence of central areas of law\\nthat have no legislative foundations—such as contract, tort,\\ntrusts, and personal property. All of these areas have seen\\nlegislative intervention, but most Common Law jurisdictions still\\nleave them on a non-statutory footing. Here the decisions of the\\ncourts are the basis of the law.   \n",

Because evil\\nposes the most difficult problems for traditional views of divine\\nprovidence, this discussion will be organized around the theme of\\nevil. In its classical formulation, the problem of evil is a problem\\nof logical consistency. The opponent of theism alleges that a triad of\\nproperties traditionally held to belong to God’s nature —\\nomniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence — are not jointly\\nconsistent with the existence of evil in the world. An omniscient God,\\nwe must assume, would have knowledge of the evil in the world. An\\nomnibenevolent God would desire to halt or prevent it, and an\\nomnipotent God should be able to do so. Yet evil is rife. It must be,\\nthen, that God lacks at least one of the triad of attributes, and\\nperhaps all of them. Perhaps as creator he is somewhat in the dark as\\nto what evils may occur, and once they appear it is too late to\\nforestall them. On the other hand, it may be that evil is endemic\\n— built into the structure of any world, so that even God is\\npowerless to prevent it. Or, maybe he just doesn’t care, and has\\nlong since turned his attention to projects more interesting than\\nnurturing our feeble destinies. Whatever the reason, the argument\\nruns, he is not the God of Abraham, of Jesus, and of Mohammed. Their\\nGod simply would not permit wanton wrongdoing, nor would he allow the\\nsuffering and duress under which all creation labors. So while the\\npresence of evil in the world does not serve to prove there is no God\\nat all, it does show there is no God of the kind adumbrated in\\nreligious tradition.   \n",

If every fact about Julius Caesar, and indeed,\\nevery other fact about the universe is rationally deducible from the\\nRoman Dictator’s complete concept, then it would seem that only\\none course for the universe is possible. However, this is not a step\\nthat Leibniz was willing to take. Were there no distinction between\\ncontingent and necessary truths, argued Leibniz, fatalism would be\\ntrue, and human liberty of the will would be impossible. Leibniz\\nsought to avert this result by distinguishing between hypothetical and\\nabsolute necessity. Absolute necessity, he argued, is governed by the\\nprinciple of contradiction. Something is absolutely necessary if its\\nnegation is logically impossible. Hypothetical necessity, on the other\\nhand, describes a state of affairs that is necessary ex\\nhypothesi—that is, just in case a particular antecedent\\nholds—but not logically necessary. On Leibniz’s account,\\nthe fact that Caesar crossed the Rubicon is only hypothetically\\nnecessary; it follows necessarily from the existence of the individual\\nsubstance that is Caesar, but its denial is not logically\\nimpossible. According to Leibniz, God at creation conceived of an\\ninfinite array of possible worlds. The myriad contingent facts of each\\nof these worlds are only hypothetically necessary. That is, they would\\nonly be necessary if God were to instantiate that world. Since the\\npresent world is the one that God chose to instantiate, all of the\\ncontingent facts of this world are certain. However, they are\\nnonetheless contingent since their negation implies no absurdity. That\\nis, there was no logical impossibility preventing Caesar from deciding\\nnot to cross the Rubicon. In this sense, his will—and, indeed,\\nhuman will generally—is free.  Leibniz’s argument for\\nhypothetical necessity has an obvious antecedent in Descartes’s\\ndoctrine of created truth. However, unlike Descartes, Leibniz limited\\nthe doctrine’s scope to contingent truths. He nonetheless hoped\\nto avoid Spinozist necessitarianism. Whether or not he succeeded in\\ndoing so is a matter of debate in the literature.   \n",

              "98   \\n\\nRickert’s theory of knowledge is designed to answer the\\nfollowing question: “what is the subject-independent yardstick of\\nknowledge? In other words, through what does knowledge receive its\\nobjectivity?” (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his\\nmajor work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge?\\nIn asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a\\ntranscendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that\\n(1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true\\nthought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some\\nthought-independent object, how are we to think this\\nthought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert\\nrejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to\\nskepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that\\nskepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be\\nmeaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely\\nwhat knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version\\nof skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl’s\\nepoché (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory\\nof knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some\\npresuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a\\nsubject successfully grasps an object. “However, the theory of\\nknowledge ought to be ‘presuppositionless’ in the sense\\nthat it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon\\nwhich the objectivity of knowledge rests” (Rickert 1921a, 12).\\nIt is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key\\nquestion as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent\\nreality existing independently of consciousness as the source\\nof validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge,\\nthen, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its\\nrelation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning\\none of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely,\\nthat there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion\\nthat validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this\\nsubject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent\\nreality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and\\npresumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be\\nprecisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully\\nconceived of as a reality and that only values can be\\nconsidered genuinely transcendent.   \n",

It is the inherent\\nincompleteness of all finite determinations which reveals the nature\\nof the absolute. His description of time makes clear what he means:\\n“time is itself nothing but the totality appearing in\\nopposition to the particular life of things”, so that the\\ntotality “posits or intuits itself, by not positing, not\\nintuiting the particular” (SW I/6, p. 220). The particular is\\ndetermined in judgements, but the truth of claims about the totality\\ncannot be proven because judgements are necessarily conditioned,\\nwhereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the\\nparticular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be\\naware of that relativity, and this ground must have a\\ndifferent status from the knowable world of finite particulars. At the\\nsame time, if the ground were wholly different from the world of\\nrelative particulars the problems of dualism would recur. As such the\\nabsolute is the finite, but we do not know this in\\nthe manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of\\n‘absolute identity’, therefore, the evident relativity of\\nparticular knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no\\nreason to claim that a revised judgement is predicated of the same\\nworld as the preceding — now false — judgement.   \n",

The particular distribution of\\nprivate property is a result of these particular acts of individuals.\\nThis act of an individual does not alone create the property right in\\nthose objects because such a one-sided declaration would violate the\\nuniversality of external right, since if one human being is to have\\nintelligible possession of a particular object, all other human beings\\nmust refrain from using that object, and thus one individual is\\nunilaterally limiting the freedom of others. Kant recognizes that any\\nunilateral declaration by one person that an object belongs to that\\nperson alone would infringe on the freedom of others. The only way\\nthat intelligible possession is possible without violating the\\nprinciple of right is if there is an agreement that puts all under an\\nobligation to recognize each other’s intelligible possessions.\\nEach person must acknowledge an obligation to refrain from using\\nobjects that belong to others. The individual act of declaring a\\nparticular object as property is rightful only when it harmonizes with\\nother similar individual acts of other persons regarding other\\nobjects. Since no individual will can rightfully make and enforce such\\na law obligating everyone to respect others’ property, this\\nmutual obligation is possible only in accordance with a\\n“collective general (common) and powerful will”, in other\\nwords, only in a civil condition. The state itself obligates all\\ncitizens to respect the property of other citizens. The state\\nfunctions as an objective, disinterested institution that resolves\\ndisputes about individual property and enforces compliance with those\\ndeterminations. Without a state to enforce these property rights, they\\nare impossible.   \n",

She anticipates that these probable\\nreasons aim at truth about the causal structure of the world and not\\njust at an accurate description and prediction of phenomena. This is\\ninteresting because this situates Du Châtelet squarely within one\\nparticular tradition with respect to hypotheses. Historically, there\\nhave been two key directions in which thinking about hypotheses\\ndeveloped, indeed from Ancient times, and certainly throughout the\\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries as well. According to one \\napproach—typified by Ptolemy in pre-modern thought and sometimes\\nassociated with “save the phenomena” type \\nexplanations—hypotheses are posited merely because they are useful\\ninstruments, mere mathematical calculating devices especially useful\\nfor prediction and scientific practice. The aim with hypotheses,\\naccording to this approach, is not to propose a true account\\nof the nature of things since reaching true conclusions about the world\\nis not necessarily relevant when formulating hypotheses according to\\nthis tradition which focuses more pointedly on prediction. According to\\nthe second approach—typified by Aristotle in pre-modern thought\\nand sometimes associated with causal explanations—hypotheses\\nare posited in order to provide an explanation of how experienced\\neffects might have come about. The aim is to give a true\\naccount of the nature of things, especially the causal nature\\nof\\n things.[22]\\nIn starting off her chapter\\non hypotheses with a mention of “the true causes of natural\\neffects”, Du Châtelet indicates her commitment to the\\nAristotelian tradition vis à viz hypotheses, a point\\nwhich becomes abundantly clear as her chapter on hypotheses\\nproceeds.   \n",

On the one hand, he\\nidentifies the eternal self-consciousness of absolute idealism with\\nGod. Green thinks that self-conscious minds are conditions of\\nconscious experience and not themselves part of conscious experience,\\nwith the result that they are outside of space and time. What is true\\nof individual minds is true of the corporate mind that Green thinks\\nmakes objectivity possible. This would make God a transcendent\\nreality. On the other hand, Green has strong reason to regard God as\\nimmanent in the world. Self-consciousness expresses itself in the\\nwill, which is the cause of action. If so, self-consciousness cannot\\nbe outside of space and time. Moreover, Green saw God as immanent in\\nindividuals and in history. The higher principle of practical reason\\nwithin each person that regulates his desires and makes him a moral\\nagent is a divine principle, the common good is the proper object of\\nthe divine principle in humanity, and its progressive realization in\\nhuman laws and institutions is how God manifests himself to the world\\n(Works III 223–27). One cannot separate Green’s\\nunorthodox form of Christianity from his idealist philosophy and his\\nethical demand that individuals subordinate their lower selves to the\\npursuit of a higher, common good.   \n",

Such an ordering is circular,\\ninasmuch as the materials from one stage are corrupted and reused in a\\nlater stage, and so there is no threat of an actual infinity. There is\\nthus nothing incoherent about such a series extending infinitely far\\ninto the past and infinitely far into the future, and indeed Ibn Rushd\\nargues that such an infinity can be proved in various ways (Davidson\\n1987). One fundamental proof arises from the nature of the First\\nCause. Since it is itself unmoved—that is, wholly\\nchangeless—its causal agency must likewise be eternal. “A\\nthing lacking the potential for change and alteration cannot be\\nchanged at any time, since if it were then its alteration would be by\\ncause of itself, and so there would be alteration without the\\npossibility for it” (LongCaelo I.103). It is, for Ibn\\nRushd, incoherent to posit an eternally existing, changeless\\nactuality, which suddenly springs into agency after having not acted\\nfor an eternity. In general, “the effect of a cause cannot be\\ndelayed after the causation” (Incoherence I.1 {15}).\\nSimilar considerations show that the world’s future existence\\nmust likewise be eternal (Incoherence 1.1 {22}).   \n",

It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological\\nmoral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of\\nteleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action\\nof all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best\\noverall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the\\nrightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might\\nfocus instead on character traits. “Virtue ethics” asserts\\nthat a right action in any given circumstance is that action a\\nvirtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this\\ncase, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or\\nwould perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both\\ncases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And\\nKant’s own views have typically been classified as deontological\\nprecisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny\\njust what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of\\nKant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character.   \n",

The various\\ntranscendentals do not differ in reality, only in concept. The concept\\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\\nreality, and a thing’s goodness adds nothing over and above the\\nthing’s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\\nwhile differing intensionally.   \n",

Therefore Gelug proposes the view that the two truths are\\nof single entity with distinct conceptual identities. This view is\\nalso founded on the theory of the two natures. But how are the two\\nnatures related? Are they identical or distinct? For Gelug argues that\\nthere are only two possibilities: either the two natures are identical\\n(ngo bo gcig) or distinct (ngo bo tha dad); there\\ncannot be a third (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176). They are related in terms of\\nbeing a single entity with distinct conceptual identities—thus\\nthey are both the same and different. Since the two natures are the\\nbasis of the relationship between the two truths, the relationship\\nbetween the two truths will reflect the relationship between the two\\nnatures. Just as the two natures are of a same entity, ultimate truth\\nand conventional truth are of same ontological status.   \n",

But when pressed late in his life to show how\\nthis status for them comported with the rest of his system, how they\\ncould be anything but modes of a single substance, in short how he\\navoided the drift into Spinozistic monism, he was in fact hard\\npressed.  In the Search After Truth, Malebranche clearly\\ncommitted himself to the view that everything is either a substance or\\na mode. In addition, he accepted Descartes’s criterion for a\\nsubstance that it be conceivable apart from everything else. However,\\nhe maintained that any given portion of extension is conceivable apart\\nfrom the rest of extension and is thus a substance. (Descartes did not\\nthink this, otherwise void space would be possible for him.) Since\\nextension is conceptually divisible to infinity, Malebranche is\\ncommitted to an infinite number of extended substances. Apart from the\\nwhole of extension, moreover, every substance contains an infinite\\nnumber of substances, of (each of) which it is a mode. It is also a\\npart of an infinite number of substances, which are modes of it. The\\nexplanatory value of the concept of substance would seem to have been\\nlost with such results as these. Malebranche’s view seems to be\\na degenerate version of Descartes’s texts to the effect,\\nsurprising but coherent, that there is but one material\\nsubstance, res extensa, whose modes are particular material\\nthings. Here the effect is to reverse the Aristotelian logic of\\nsubstance. To say of \\(x\\), a particular thing, that it is extended\\n\\(E\\), is to say not that a substance \\(x\\) has a property \\(E\\), but\\nthat \\(x\\) is a mode of\\nres extensa.   \n",

For example, Kumārila charges that the Buddhist\\napoha theories are counter-intuitive in that our intuition is\\nnot that words and concepts refer to negations or exclusions.\\nŚāntarakṣita argues that Kumārila misunderstands\\napoha to always be non-implicative negations. He misses the\\ntwo types of implicative negations that Śāntarakṣita\\nclearly specifies as included among forms of exclusions. For\\nŚāntarakṣita, when we use words, the objects of such\\nconceptual thoughts are the real objects. They are the indirect object\\nof the exclusion that is a form of implicative negation, which\\nincludes negative aspects by implication. Thus, words can be\\nindicative of positive elements. The external object implies the image\\nplus the exclusion of that which is other. The words or concepts thus\\ntake external objects as their objects and imply the conceptual\\nexclusions. Thus when Kumārila mistakes all exclusions to be\\nnon-implicative negations, he misses this key component to the\\npsychological functions at work and mistakes apoha theory to\\nbe counter-intuitive.   \n",

In Damian’s view, it does not follow from the doctrine\\nthat we should think that God would be able to do anything whatsoever.\\nAdmittedly, there are many things that God cannot do, e.g., God cannot\\nlie (e.g., 597C). Lying is an evil thing. In Damian’s view, an agent\\nneed not be able to do evil in order to qualify as omnipotent because\\nnot being able to do evil is no sign of impotence or inability.\\nActually, God cannot do anything that is evil and he can do anything\\nthat is good. By “omnipotence”, Damian means this ability\\nto do anything that is good. This ability can properly be characterized\\nas “omnipotence” because evil things are\\n“nothing” (nihil). To be capable of\\n“everything” (omnia), an agent must be capable of\\nanything that is “something” (aliquid), but he\\nneed not be capable of “nothing” (598D–599A, 600A–B,\\n610C–D).   \n",

Dietrich gives a very precise answer\\nto this question based no doubt on his acceptance of Proclus’\\nexposition of the principles of generation within the hierarchy of\\nbeing. The agent intellect, according to this explanation, is the\\nintrinsic efficient cause of the soul. That it cannot be the material\\ncause Dietrich thinks is self-evident. It cannot be the final cause\\nsince a final cause perfects a thing, but does not establish it in\\nbeing, which is what the agent intellect does for the soul. But it is\\nmore important to understand, Dietrich insists, that the agent\\nintellect cannot be the formal cause of the soul—at least not in the\\nnatural order of things. He argues that if it was the formal cause of\\nthe soul, given that the soul by definition is the formal cause of the\\nhuman person, then it would follow that there would be a form of a\\nform in the same genus, man. But this is contrary to the natural order\\nof things because whatever is the form of something in the genus of\\nsubstance is by the whole of itself the act of its subject. Thus the\\nsame thing cannot be in potency to more than one form in its genus.\\nPerhaps we can understand Dietrich’s remarks about the vision of St.\\nBenedict mentioned above in terms of this analysis. Man is not\\n“fully joined” to his intellect in the sense that the\\nintellect is not his form. If it were his form, he, like Benedict,\\nwould understand the entire universe of beings in a single mental\\nact. But such a vision belongs to the order of grace, not to the order\\nof natural providence.   \n",

He pointed out that if one moves beyond the natural numbers\\nand climbs the hierarchy of types (the sets of natural numbers, the\\nsets of sets of natural numbers, etc.) one arrives at axioms (the\\naxioms of second-order arithmetic PA2, the axioms of third-order\\narithmetic PA3, etc.) that settle the undecided statements that he\\ndiscovered.  The axiom system for the second level, PA2, settles\\nthe statement left undecided at the first level, namely Con(PA);\\nin fact, PA2 proves Con(PA), which is the desired result.  But\\nnow we have a problem at the second level.  For the second\\nincompleteness theorem shows that (under similar background\\nassumptions to those above) PA2 does not settle Con(PA2).\\nFortunately, the axiom system for the third level, PA3, settles\\nthe statement left undecided at the second level, namely\\nCon(PA2).  This pattern continues.  For every problem there is a\\nsolution and for every solution there is a new problem.  In this way,\\nby climbing the hierarchy of types one arrives at systems that\\nsuccessively settle the consistency statements that arise along the\\nway.   \n",

One of Russell’s\\nearly diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all classes that are\\nnot members of themselves was that it showed that classes could not be\\nindividuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come across his paradox by\\napplying Cantor’s famous diagonal argument to show that there\\nare more classes of individuals than individuals. Hence, he concluded,\\nclasses could not be individuals, and expressions for classes such as\\n‘\\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\)’ cannot be the singular terms they appear\\nto be. Inspired by the theory of descriptions, Russell proposed that\\nto say something \\(G\\) of the class of \\(F\\)s, \\(G\\) \\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\),\\nis to say that there is some (predicative) property \\(H\\) coextensive\\nwith (true of the same things as) \\(F\\) such that \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). The\\nrestriction to predicative properties, or those which are not defined\\nin terms of quantification over other properties, was a consequence of\\nthe ramification of the theory of types to avoid intensional\\nor “epistemic” paradoxes which motivated the theory of\\ntypes in addition to the set theoretical “Russell’s\\nParadox” (see Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, Introduction,\\nChapter II). These predicative properties are intensional, however, in\\nthe sense that two distinct properties might hold of the same objects.\\n(See the entry on the\\n notation in Principia Mathematica.)\\n That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus\\nderivable, rather than postulated. If \\(F\\) and \\(H\\) are coextensive\\nthen anything true of \\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\) will be true of \\(\\{x:Hx \\}\\).\\nFeatures of classes then follow from the features of the logic of\\nproperties.   \n",
